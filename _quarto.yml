  title: "MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS"
  subtitle: "with TinyML"
  abstract: Machine Learning Systems with TinyML offers an introduction to end-to-end machine learning pipelines by focusing on their implementation on resource-constrained devicesds. TinyML provides an accessible lens through which to cover general principles and best practices for applying machine learning. As edge computing grows, performant TinyML enables AI on embedded devices. This book provides the expertise to deploy complete machine learning systems - from data preparation to model training, optimization, acceleration and production deployment - seen through the lens of tinyML applications. The book covers important topics like efficient neural network architectures, hardware-aware training, model compression, benchmarking, and on-device learning. Additional chapters highlight advances like on-device data generation and considerations around reliability, privacy, security, and responsible AI. With concrete use cases and hands-on examples, readers will learn to implement end-to-end machine learning workflows on embedded devices. Overall, by grounding the introduction in tinyML applications, the book enables readers to develop specialized knowledge while also learning general concepts for applying machine learning systems to transform edge devices and IoT.
