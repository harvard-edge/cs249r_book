  title: "{{< var title.short >}}"
  subtitle: "with TinyML"
  abstract: "{{< var title.long >}} offers an accessible entry into the fascinating world of computing that enables machine learning, with a special focus on its implementation in resource-constrained environments using TinyML. Serving as an ideal starting point for newcomers to the field, this book provides insight into the principles and best practices in machine learning through the practical lens of TinyML. As edge computing continues to expand, the importance of efficient ML applications in such environments grows. This book aims to demystify the complex process of deploying complete machine learning systems, encompassing everything from initial data preparation and model training to optimization, acceleration, and eventual deployment. We explore key topics such as efficient neural network architectures, hardware-aware training, model compression, benchmarking, and on-device learning. Additionally, the text delves into emerging areas like on-device data generation, while addressing crucial considerations of reliability, privacy, security, and responsible AI in resource-constrained environments. By grounding these concepts in TinyML, the book imparts our specialized knowledge and offers an introduction to general machine learning techniques. It strives to ensure that readers are well-equipped to transform edge devices and IoT through the application of machine learning."
