# /improve Command v2.0 - Complete Chapter Review System

## Overview
A systematic, Git-integrated process to review and improve textbook chapters for optimal student learning progression. Includes proper version control workflow and organized temporary file management.

## Command Usage
```bash
/improve [chapter_file.qmd]
```

## üîß **Complete Workflow**

### Phase 0: Git Setup (REQUIRED)
```bash
# 1. Ensure clean dev branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b improve-[chapter-name]-comprehension

# 3. Create temporary files directory
mkdir -p .temp/chapter-reviews/
```

### Phase 1: Analysis & Issue Identification
- Read chapter as first-time student
- Track knowledge accumulation section by section
- Identify comprehension barriers:
  - **Jargon Jump**: Terms used before definition
  - **Concept Gap**: Ideas requiring unexplained prerequisites  
  - **Context Missing**: Examples lacking background
  - **Progression Break**: Logical flow disrupted

### Phase 2: Documentation & Prioritization
Create tracking files in `.temp/chapter-reviews/`:
- `[chapter]_review_tracking.md` - Issue documentation
- `[chapter]_analysis_notes.md` - Detailed analysis
- `improve_session_[chapter]_[date].md` - Session summary

**Priority Levels:**
1. **High Priority**: Foundation concepts affecting downstream learning
2. **Medium Priority**: Flow and clarity improvements  
3. **Low Priority**: Minor polish and refinements

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Fix one issue at a time
- Validate each change before moving on
- Maintain academic tone throughout
- Keep sections appropriately sized (Purpose = 1 paragraph)
- Ensure smooth knowledge progression

### Phase 4: Validation & Git Completion
```bash
# 1. Final validation
# Re-read chapter for smooth progression
# Update tracking documents

# 2. Commit changes
git add quarto/contents/core/[chapter]/[chapter].qmd
git commit -m "feat(content): improve [chapter] chapter comprehension

- Fix foundation concept scaffolding
- Resolve technical term progression issues
- Maintain academic tone throughout
- Ensure smooth learning progression

Addresses comprehension barriers for first-time readers."

# 3. Push feature branch
git push origin improve-[chapter-name]-comprehension

# 4. Temporary files remain in .temp/ for later cleanup
```

## üìÅ **File Organization**

### Temporary Files Structure
```
.temp/chapter-reviews/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [chapter]_review_tracking.md      # Issue tracking and fixes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [chapter]_analysis_notes.md       # Detailed analysis notes  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [chapter]_validation_log.md       # Validation results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ improve_session_[chapter]_[date].md  # Session summary
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cleanup_chapter_reviews.sh       # Cleanup utility
```

### Cleanup Management
```bash
# List temporary files
.temp/cleanup_chapter_reviews.sh --list

# Archive files for long-term storage
.temp/cleanup_chapter_reviews.sh --archive

# Delete all temporary files (destructive)
.temp/cleanup_chapter_reviews.sh --clean

# Show disk usage
.temp/cleanup_chapter_reviews.sh --size
```
