# 📐 Mission Plan: 16_ml_conclusion (System Synthesis)

## 1. Chapter Context
*   **Chapter Title:** ML Conclusion: The Architect's Synthesis.
*   **Core Invariant:** System Synthesis (The D·A·M Convergence) and the **Conservation of Complexity**.
*   **The Struggle:** Synthesizing all 12 physical invariants to solve a final, integrated engineering crisis. Understanding that complexity is never destroyed, only shifted between Data, Algorithm, and Machine.
*   **Target Duration:** 45 Minutes.

## 2. The 4-Track Storyboard (Single-Node Finales)

| Track | Persona | Fixed North Star Mission | The "Synthesis" Crisis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Titan** | LLM Architect | Maximize Llama-3-70B serving. | **The Multimodal Memory Wall.** You are adding a Vision Encoder to your chatbot. You must balance the memory-bound decoding of the LLM with the compute-bound encoding of the Vision model on one card. |
| **Edge Guardian** | AV Systems Lead | Deterministic 10ms safety loop. | **The Shadow Mode Gap.** A new Transformer-based end-to-end model has arrived. You must prove it respects the 10ms budget and the 'Verification Gap' before it is allowed to touch the steering wheel. |
| **Mobile Nomad** | AR Glasses Dev | 60FPS AR translation. | **The Thermal Intelligence Ceiling.** Marketing wants to add 'Reasoning' to the 60FPS filters. You must find the exact point where intelligence exceeds the fixed 2W thermal envelope. |
| **Tiny Pioneer** | Hearable Lead | Neural isolation in <10ms under 1mW. | **The Universal Translator Paradox.** You are scaling from 1 language to 50. The Embedding Table Gravity now exceeds your 256KB SRAM. You must engineer a 'Streaming Weights' strategy. |

## 3. The 3-Part Mission (The KATs)

### Part 1: The Diagnostic Challenge (Exploration - 15 Mins)
*   **Objective:** Diagnose an unexplained production failure using the full "Systems Detective" toolkit.
*   **The "Lock" (Prediction):** "If accuracy drops 10% but latency remains stable, is the bottleneck more likely to be 'Data Drift' or 'Framework Overhead'?"
*   **The Workbench:**
    *   **Action:** Probe the system for **Statistical Drift**, **Training-Serving Skew**, and **Iron Law bottlenecks** simultaneously.
    *   **Observation:** The **Diagnostic HUD**. A multi-gauge view showing PSI (Drift), MFU (Utilization), and latency components.
*   **Reflect:** "Patterson asks: 'Identify the exact invariant that was violated.' Use the diagnostic data to prove your root-cause analysis."

### Part 2: The Upgrade Paradox (Trade-off - 15 Mins)
*   **Objective:** Navigate a multi-objective Pareto Frontier to "Design the Future" of your track.
*   **The "Lock" (Prediction):** "Will upgrading to a larger model improve your 'Samples-per-Dollar' if the system becomes more memory-bound?"
*   **The Workbench:**
    *   **Sliders:** All DAM levers (Data resolution, Algorithm complexity, Machine BW/TFLOPS).
    *   **Instruments:** **Master Synthesis Radar**. A radar chart showing Accuracy, Latency, Energy, Carbon, and TCO.
    *   **The 15-Iteration Rule:** Students must "Dimension" a next-generation system that hits a 2x accuracy goal while staying within the same 3-year TCO budget.
*   **Reflect:** "Jeff Dean observes: 'You successfully reduced the Algorithm complexity, but the total system cost stayed the same.' Explain how the 'Conservation of Complexity' manifested in your design."

### Part 3: Node to Fleet (Synthesis - 15 Mins)
*   **Objective:** Identify the physical limit of the "Single Node" and prepare for Volume 2.
*   **The "Lock" (Prediction):** "At what exact model scale or user load does your single-node architecture hit an absolute physical wall that no further local optimization can fix?"
*   **The Workbench:** 
    *   **Interaction:** **Scale-out Scrubber**. Slide the load until the "Node Feasibility" gauge turns permanently red.
    *   **The "Stakeholder" Challenge:** The **CEO** demands a 100x scale-up. You must use **Amdahl's Law** to prove that single-node physics have reached their saturation point.
*   **Reflect (The Ledger):** "Defend your 'Graduation' to Volume 2. What specific constraint (Network, Reliability, or Contention) is now forcing you to move from 'The Node' to 'The Fleet'?"
