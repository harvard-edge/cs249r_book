Although most edge devices have limited resources, time and energy costs are important when running TinyML applications. In this paper, we propose a structure in which the part that preprocesses externally input data in the TinyML application is distributed to the hardware. These processes are performed using software in the microcontroller unit of an edge device. Furthermore, resistor&ndash;transistor logic, which perform not only windowing using the Hann function, but also acquire audio raw data, is added to the inter-integrated circuit sound module that collects audio data in the voice-recognition application. As a result of the experiment, the windowing function was excluded from the TinyML application of the embedded board. When the length of the hardware-implemented Hann window is 80 and the quantization degree is 2&minus;5, the exclusion causes a decrease in the execution time of the front-end function and energy consumption by 8.06% and 3.27%, respectively.}

	abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) have shown excellent performance on various tasks, but the astronomical model size raises the hardware barrier for serving (memory size) and slows down token generation (memory bandwidth). In this paper, we propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), a hardware-friendly approach for LLM low-bit weight-only quantization. Our method is based on the observation that weights are not equally important: protecting only 1% of salient weights can greatly reduce quantization error. We then propose to search for the optimal perchannel scaling that protects the salient weights by observing the activation, not weights. AWQ does not rely on any backpropagation or reconstruction, so it can well preserve LLMs’ generalization ability on different domains and modalities, without overfitting to the calibration set. AWQ outperforms existing work on various language modeling and domain-specific benchmarks. Thanks to better generalization, it achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned LMs and, for the first time, multi-modal LMs. Alongside AWQ, we implement an efficient and flexible inference framework tailored for LLMs on the edge, offering more than 3× speedup over the Huggingface FP16 implementation on both desktop and mobile GPUs. It also democratizes the deployment of the 70B Llama-2 model on mobile GPU (NVIDIA Jetson Orin 64GB).}

We provide a meta-analysis of the literature, including an overview of approaches to pruning and consistent findings in the literature. After aggregating results across 81 papers and pruning hundreds of models in controlled conditions, our clearest finding is that the community suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics. This deficiency is substantial enough that it is hard to compare pruning techniques to one another or determine how much progress the field has made over the past three decades. To address this situation, we identify issues with current practices, suggest concrete remedies, and introduce ShrinkBench, an open-source framework to facilitate standardized evaluations of pruning methods. We use ShrinkBench to compare various pruning techniques and show that its comprehensive evaluation can prevent common pitfalls when comparing pruning methods.},

	abstract     = {Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, we introduce "deep compression", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3x to 4x layerwise speedup and 3x to 7x better energy efficiency.}

However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance. We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the "lottery ticket hypothesis:" dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks ("winning tickets") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20\% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.},

	abstract     = {The remarkable performance of deep Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is generally attributed to their deeper and wider architectures, which can come with significant computational costs. Pruning neural networks has thus gained interest since it effectively lowers storage and computational costs. In contrast to weight pruning, which results in unstructured models, structured pruning provides the benefit of realistic acceleration by producing models that are friendly to hardware implementation. The special requirements of structured pruning have led to the discovery of numerous new challenges and the development of innovative solutions. This article surveys the recent progress towards structured pruning of deep CNNs. We summarize and compare the state-of-the-art structured pruning techniques with respect to filter ranking methods, regularization methods, dynamic execution, neural architecture search, the lottery ticket hypothesis, and the applications of pruning. While discussing structured pruning algorithms, we briefly introduce the unstructured pruning counterpart to emphasize their differences. Furthermore, we provide insights into potential research opportunities in the field of structured pruning.

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model.

MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyper-parameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.},

	abstract     = {Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet). The SqueezeNet architecture is available for download here: https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet},

We focus on quantization techniques that are amenable to acceleration by processors with high-throughput integer math pipelines. We also present a workflow for 8-bit quantization that is able to maintain accuracy within 1% of the floating-point baseline on all networks studied, including models that are more difficult to quantize, such as MobileNets and BERT-large.}

Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors.},

	abstract     = {Pruning is a widely used technique for reducing the size of deep neural networks while maintaining their performance. However, such a technique, despite being able to massively compress deep models, is hardly able to remove entire layers from a model (even when structured): is this an addressable task? In this study, we introduce EGP, an innovative Entropy Guided Pruning algorithm aimed at reducing the size of deep neural networks while preserving their performance. The key focus of EGP is to prioritize pruning connections in layers with low entropy, ultimately leading to their complete removal. Through extensive experiments conducted on popular models like ResNet-18 and Swin-T, our findings demonstrate that EGP effectively compresses deep neural networks while maintaining competitive performance levels. Our results not only shed light on the underlying mechanism behind the advantages of unstructured pruning, but also pave the way for further investigations into the intricate relationship between entropy, pruning techniques, and deep learning performance. The EGP algorithm and its insights hold great promise for advancing the field of network compression and optimization. The source code for EGP is released open-source.},

	abstract     = {Machine learning on tiny IoT devices based on microcontroller units (MCU) is appealing but challenging: the memory of microcontrollers is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller even than mobile phones. We propose MCUNet, a framework that jointly designs the efficient neural architecture (TinyNAS) and the lightweight inference engine (TinyEngine), enabling ImageNet-scale inference on microcontrollers. TinyNAS adopts a two-stage neural architecture search approach that first optimizes the search space to fit the resource constraints, then specializes the network architecture in the optimized search space. TinyNAS can automatically handle diverse constraints (i.e.device, latency, energy, memory) under low search costs.TinyNAS is co-designed with TinyEngine, a memory-efficient inference library to expand the search space and fit a larger model. TinyEngine adapts the memory scheduling according to the overall network topology rather than layer-wise optimization, reducing the memory usage by 4.8x, and accelerating the inference by 1.7-3.3x compared to TF-Lite Micro and CMSIS-NN. MCUNet is the first to achieves {\textgreater}70\% ImageNet top1 accuracy on an off-the-shelf commercial microcontroller, using 3.5x less SRAM and 5.7x less Flash compared to quantized MobileNetV2 and ResNet-18. On visual\&audio wake words tasks, MCUNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and runs 2.4-3.4x faster than MobileNetV2 and ProxylessNAS-based solutions with 3.7-4.1x smaller peak SRAM. Our study suggests that the era of always-on tiny machine learning on IoT devices has arrived. Code and models can be found here: https://tinyml.mit.edu.},

	abstract     = {Low-rank matrix factorization (MF) is an important technique in data science. The key idea of MF is that there exists latent structures in the data, by uncovering which we could obtain a compressed representation of the data. By factorizing an original matrix to low-rank matrices, MF provides a unified method for dimension reduction, clustering, and matrix completion. In this article we review several important variants of MF, including: Basic MF, Non-negative MF, Orthogonal non-negative MF. As can be told from their names, non-negative MF and orthogonal non-negative MF are variants of basic MF with non-negativity and/or orthogonality constraints. Such constraints are useful in specific senarios. In the first part of this article, we introduce, for each of these models, the application scenarios, the distinctive properties, and the optimizing method. By properly adapting MF, we can go beyond the problem of clustering and matrix completion. In the second part of this article, we will extend MF to sparse matrix compeletion, enhance matrix compeletion using various regularization methods, and make use of MF for (semi-)supervised learning by introducing latent space reinforcement and transformation. We will see that MF is not only a useful model but also as a flexible framework that is applicable for various prediction problems.},

	abstract     = {Deep neural networks have achieved great success in many data processing applications. However, the high computational complexity and storage cost makes deep learning hard to be used on resource-constrained devices, and it is not environmental-friendly with much power cost. In this paper, we focus on low-rank optimization for efficient deep learning techniques. In the space domain, deep neural networks are compressed by low rank approximation of the network parameters, which directly reduces the storage requirement with a smaller number of network parameters. In the time domain, the network parameters can be trained in a few subspaces, which enables efficient training for fast convergence. The model compression in the spatial domain is summarized into three categories as pre-train, pre-set, and compression-aware methods, respectively. With a series of integrable techniques discussed, such as sparse pruning, quantization, and entropy coding, we can ensemble them in an integration framework with lower computational complexity and storage. Besides of summary of recent technical advances, we have two findings for motivating future works: one is that the effective rank outperforms other sparse measures for network compression. The other is a spatial and temporal balance for tensorized neural networks.},

In this paper, we propose a novel pruning-based paradigm that aims to reduce the computational cost of DNNs, by uncovering a more compact structure and learning the effective weights therein, on the basis of not compromising the expressive capability of DNNs. In particular, our algorithm can achieve efficient end-to-end training that transfers a redundant neural network to a compact one with a specifically targeted compression rate directly. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on various representative benchmark datasets and compared with typical advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The experimental results verify the superior performance and robust effectiveness of our scheme. For example, when pruning VGG on CIFAR-10, our proposed scheme is able to significantly reduce its FLOPs (floating-point operations) and number of parameters with a proportion of 76.2\% and 94.1\%, respectively, while still maintaining a satisfactory accuracy. To sum up, our scheme could facilitate the integration of DNNs into the common machine-learning-based IoT framework and establish distributed training of neural networks in both cloud and edge.},

Per-channel quantization of weights and per-layer quantization of activations to 8-bits of precision post-training produces classification accuracies within 2% of floating point networks for a wide variety of CNN architectures. Model sizes can be reduced by a factor of 4 by quantizing weights to 8-bits, even when 8-bit arithmetic is not supported. This can be achieved with simple, post training quantization of weights.We benchmark latencies of quantized networks on CPUs and DSPs and observe a speedup of 2x-3x for quantized implementations compared to floating point on CPUs. Speedups of up to 10x are observed on specialized processors with fixed point SIMD capabilities, like the Qualcomm QDSPs with HVX. Quantization-aware training can provide further improvements, reducing the gap to floating point to 1% at 8-bit precision. Quantization-aware training also allows for reducing the precision of weights to four bits with accuracy losses ranging from 2% to 10%, with higher accuracy drop for smaller networks.We introduce tools in TensorFlow and TensorFlowLite for quantizing convolutional networks and review best practices for quantization-aware training to obtain high accuracy with quantized weights and activations. We recommend that per-channel quantization of weights and per-layer quantization of activations be the preferred quantization scheme for hardware acceleration and kernel optimization. We also propose that future processors and hardware accelerators for optimized inference support precisions of 4, 8 and 16 bits.}

This paper examines three simple magnitude-based pruning schemes to compress NMT models, namely class-blind, class-uniform, and class-distribution, which differ in terms of how pruning thresholds are computed for the different classes of weights in the NMT architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of weight pruning as a compression technique for a state-of-the-art NMT system. We show that an NMT model with over 200 million parameters can be pruned by 40\% with very little performance loss as measured on the WMT'14 English-German translation task. This sheds light on the distribution of redundancy in the NMT architecture. Our main result is that with retraining, we can recover and even surpass the original performance with an 80\%-pruned model.},

However, existing methods cannot maintain accuracy and hardware efficiency at the same time. We propose SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving, and general-purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs. Based on the fact that weights are easy to quantize while activations are not, SmoothQuant smooths the activation outliers by offline migrating the quantization difficulty from activations to weights with a mathematically equivalent transformation. SmoothQuant enables an INT8 quantization of both weights and activations for all the matrix multiplications in LLMs, including OPT, BLOOM, GLM, MT-NLG, and LLaMA family. We demonstrate up to 1.56x speedup and 2x memory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy. SmoothQuant enables serving 530B LLM within a single node. Our work offers a turn-key solution that reduces hardware costs and democratizes LLMs.}

Strongly related to the problem of numerical representation is the problem of quantization: in what manner should a set of continuous real-valued numbers be distributed over a fixed discrete set of numbers to minimize the number of bits required and also to maximize the accuracy of the attendant computations? This perennial problem of quantization is particularly relevant whenever memory and/or computational resources are severely restricted, and it has come to the forefront in recent years due to the remarkable performance of Neural Network models in computer vision, natural language processing, and related areas. Moving from floating-point representations to low-precision fixed integer values represented in four bits or less holds the potential to reduce the memory footprint and latency by a factor of 16x; and, in fact, reductions of 4x to 8x are often realized in practice in these applications. Thus, it is not surprising that quantization has emerged recently as an important and very active sub-area of research in the efficient implementation of computations associated with Neural Networks. In this article, we survey approaches to the problem of quantizing the numerical values in deep Neural Network computations, covering the advantages/disadvantages of current methods. With this survey and its organization, we hope to have presented a useful snapshot of the current research in quantization for Neural Networks and to have given an intelligent organization to ease the evaluation of future research in this area.}

	abstract     = {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7\%), Flowers (98.8\%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
