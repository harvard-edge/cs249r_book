Neural networks form the basis of deep learning, drawing inspiration from the biological neural networks of the human brain to process and analyze data in a hierarchical manner. Below, we dissect the primary components and structures commonly found in neural networks.

### Perceptrons

At the foundation of neural networks is the perceptron, a basic unit or node that forms the basis of more complex structures. A perceptron receives various inputs, applies weights and a bias to these inputs, and then employs an activation function to produce an output as shown below in @fig-perceptron.

![Perceptron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Rosenblattperceptron.png/500px-Rosenblattperceptron.png){#fig-perceptron}

Initially conceptualized in the 1950s, perceptrons paved the way for the development of more intricate neural networks, serving as a fundamental building block in the field of deep learning.


### Multi-layer Perceptrons

Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) evolve from the single-layer perceptron model, incorporating multiple layers of nodes connected in a feedforward manner. These layers include an input layer to receive data, several hidden layers to process this data, and an output layer to generate the final results. MLPs excel in identifying non-linear relationships, utilizing a backpropagation technique for training, wherein the weights are optimized through a gradient descent algorithm.

![TensorFlow Computational Graph](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/guide/images/intro_to_graphs/two-layer-network.png?raw=1)

#### Forward Pass

The forward pass denotes the initial phase where data progresses through the network from the input to the output layer. During this phase, each layer conducts specific computations on the input data, utilizing weights and biases before passing the resulting values onto subsequent layers. The ultimate output of this phase is employed to compute the loss, representing the disparity between the predicted output and actual target values.

#### Backward Pass (Backpropagation)

Backpropagation signifies a pivotal algorithm in the training of deep neural networks. This phase involves computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight using the chain rule, effectively maneuvering backwards through the network. The gradients calculated in this step guide the adjustment of weights with the objective of minimizing the loss function, thereby enhancing the network's performance with each iteration of training.

Grasping these foundational concepts paves the way to understanding more intricate deep learning architectures and techniques, fostering the development of more sophisticated and efficacious applications, especially within the realm of embedded AI systems.

### Training Concepts

In the realm of deep learning, it's crucial to comprehend various key concepts and terms that set the foundation for creating, training, and optimizing deep neural networks. This section clarifies these essential concepts, providing a straightforward path to delve deeper into the intricate dynamics of deep learning. Overall, ML training is an iterative process. An untrained neural network model takes some features as input and makes a forward prediction pass. Given some ground truth about the prediction, which is known during the training process, we can compute a loss using a loss function and update the neural network parameters during the backward pass. We repeat this process until the network converges towards correct predictions with satisfactory accuracy.

![An iterative approach to training a model.](https://developers.google.com/static/machine-learning/crash-course/images/GradientDescentDiagram.svg)

#### Loss Functions

Loss functions, also known as cost functions, quantify how well a neural network is performing by calculating the difference between the actual and predicted outputs. The objective during the training process is to minimize this loss function to improve the model's accuracy. As @fig-loss shows, models can either have high loss or low loss depending on where in the training phase the network is in. 

![High loss in the left model; low loss in the right model.](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/images/LossSideBySide.png){#fig-loss}
