## Overview

### Definition and Importance

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), involves algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, called artificial neural networks. It stands as a cornerstone in the field of AI, spearheading advancements in various domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. Its relevance in embedded AI systems is underscored by its ability to facilitate complex computations and predictions, leveraging the limited resources available in embedded environments.

### Brief History of Deep Learning

The concept of deep learning has its roots in the early artificial neural networks. It has witnessed several waves of popularity, starting with the introduction of the Perceptron in the 1950s, followed by the development of backpropagation algorithms in the 1980s.

The term "deep learning" emerged in the 2000s, marked by breakthroughs in computational power and data availability. Key milestones include the successful training of deep networks by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hinton_4791679.cfm), one of the god fathers of AI, and the resurgence of neural networks as a potent tool for data analysis and modeling.

In recent years, deep learning has witnessed exponential growth, becoming a transformative force across various industries. @fig-trends shows that we are currently in the third era of deep learning. From 1952 to 2010, computational growth followed an 18-month doubling pattern. This dramatically accelerated to a 6-month cycle from 2010 to 2022. At the same time, we witnessed the advent of major-scale models between 2015 and 2022; these appeared 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster and followed a 10-month doubling cycle.

A confluence of factors has fueled this surge, including advancements in computational power, the proliferation of big data, and improvements in algorithmic designs. Firstly, the expansion of computational capabilities, particularly the advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), has significantly accelerated the training and inference times of deep learning models. These hardware advancements have made it feasible to construct and train more complex, deeper networks than were possible in the earlier years.

Secondly, the digital revolution has brought forth an abundance of "big" data, providing rich material for deep learning models to learn from and excel in tasks such as image and speech recognition, language translation, and game playing. The availability of large, labeled datasets has been instrumental in the refinement and successful deployment of deep learning applications in real-world scenarios.

Additionally, collaborations and open-source initiatives have fostered a vibrant community of researchers and practitioners, propelling rapid advancements in deep learning techniques. Innovations such as deep reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and generative adversarial networks have expanded the boundaries of what is achievable with deep learning, opening new avenues and opportunities in various fields including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.

Companies and organizations worldwide are recognizing the transformative potential of deep learning, investing heavily in research and development to harness its power in offering innovative solutions, optimizing operations, and creating new business opportunities. As deep learning continues its upward trajectory, it is poised to revolutionize how we interact with technology, making our lives more convenient, safe, and connected.

### Applications of Deep Learning

Deep learning is widely used in many industries today. It is used in finance for things such as stock market prediction, risk assessment, and fraud detection. It is also used in marketing for things such as customer segmentation, personalization, and content optimization. In healthcare, machine learning is used for tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient monitoring. It has had a transformational impact on our society. 

An example of the transformative impact that machine learning has had on society is how it has saved money and lives. For example, as mentioned earlier, deep learning algorithms can make predictions about stocks, like predicting whether they will go up or down. These predictions guide investment strategies and improve financial decisions. Similarly, deep learning can also make medical predictions to improve patient diagnosis and save lives. The possibilities are endless and the benefits are clear. Machine learning is not only able to make predictions with greater accuracy than humans but it is also able to do so at a much faster pace.

Deep learning has been applied to manufacturing to great effect. By using software to constantly learn from the vast amounts of data collected throughout the manufacturing process, companies are able to increase productivity while reducing wastage through improved efficiency. Companies are benefiting financially from these effects while customers are receiving better quality products at lower prices. Machine learning enables manufacturers to constantly improve their processes to create higher quality goods faster and more efficiently than ever before.

Deep learning has also improved products that we use daily like Netflix recommendations or Google Translate's text translations, but it also allows companies such as Amazon and Uber to save money on customer service costs by quickly identifying unhappy customers. 

### Relevance to Embedded AI

Embedded AI, which involves integrating AI algorithms directly into hardware devices, naturally benefits from the capabilities of deep learning. The synergy of deep learning algorithms with embedded systems has paved the way for intelligent, autonomous devices capable of sophisticated on-device data processing and analysis. Deep learning facilitates the extraction of intricate patterns and information from input data, making it a vital tool in the development of smart embedded systems, ranging from household appliances to industrial machines. This union aims to foster a new era of smart, interconnected devices that can learn and adapt to user behaviors and environmental conditions, optimizing performance and offering unprecedented levels of convenience and efficiency.
