# ML Systems Cross-Reference Filters
# ===================================
# Configuration for excluding files and sections that don't contain substantive technical content

# File-level exclusions (applied to entire files)
exclude_files:
  # Skip entire files matching these patterns
  patterns:
    - "conclusion.qmd"     # Skip introduction files
    - ".*getting[_-]started.*"
    - ".*setup.*"
    - ".*installation.*"
    - ".*quiz.*"
    - ".*exercise.*"
    - ".*lab.*"
    - ".*tutorial.*"
    - ".*walkthrough.*"

# Section-level exclusions (applied to individual sections within files)
exclude_sections:
  # All patterns support regex - simple strings work as literals
  patterns:
    - "^about$"              # Exact match (anchored)
    - "^acknowledgments$"
    - "^chapter summary$"
    - "^conclusion$"
    - "^getting started$"
    - "^installation$"
    - "^introduction$"
    - "^key takeaways$"
    - "^learning objectives$"
    - "^looking ahead$"
    - "^next steps$"
    - "^overview$"
    - "^prerequisites$"
    - "^purpose$"
    - "^references$"
    - "^setup$"
    - "^summary$"
    - "^table of contents$"
    - ".*quiz.*"            # Pattern match (anywhere)
    - ".*exercise.*"
    - ".*homework.*"
    - ".*assignment.*"
    - ".*lab [0-9]+.*"
    - ".*tutorial.*"
    - ".*walkthrough.*"
    - ".*step [0-9]+.*"

# Content-based filtering rules
content_filters:
  min_length: 200        # Skip sections shorter than 200 chars
  max_length: 15000      # Skip extremely long sections (likely auto-generated)
  
  # Skip sections containing these meta-content indicators
  exclude_if_contains:
    - "learning outcome"
    - "this chapter will"
    - "by the end of this"
    - "upon completion"
    - "you will learn"
    - "learning goal"
    - "this section covers"
    - "prerequisite"
    - "before you begin"
    - "installation guide"
    - "setup instruction"
    - "download and install"

# Quality filters
quality_filters:
  # Skip sections that are mostly lists/bullets
  max_list_ratio: 0.7    # If >70% of lines start with - or *, skip
  
  # Skip sections with too many code blocks
  max_code_ratio: 0.8    # If >80% is code, likely not conceptual
  
  # Skip sections that are mostly references/citations
  max_citation_ratio: 0.3 # If >30% is [@citations], skip
