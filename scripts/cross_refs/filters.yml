# ML Systems Cross-Reference Filters
# ===================================
# Configuration for excluding files and sections that don't contain substantive technical content

# File-level exclusions (applied to entire files)
exclude_files:
  # Skip entire files matching these patterns
  patterns:
    - "conclusion.qmd"           # Skip conclusion files
    - ".*getting[_-]started.*"
    - ".*setup.*"
    - ".*installation.*"
    - ".*quiz.*"
    - ".*exercise.*"
    - ".*lab.*"
    - ".*tutorial.*"
    - ".*walkthrough.*"

# Section-level exclusions (applied to individual sections within files)
exclude_sections:
  # Focus on truly meta-content, not substantial technical sections
  patterns:
    - "purpose"               # Often just intro fluff
    - "^learning objectives$"   # Meta-content
    - "^prerequisites$"         # Meta-content
    - "^key takeaways$"         # Summary content
    - "^summary$"               # Summary content
    - "^getting started$"
    - "^installation$"
    - "^setup$"
    - "^about$"
    - "^acknowledgments$"
    - "^references$"
    - "^table of contents$"
    - ".*quiz.*"               # Quiz/exercise content
    - ".*exercise.*"
    - ".*homework.*"
    - ".*assignment.*"
    - ".*lab [0-9]+.*"
    - ".*tutorial.*"
    - ".*walkthrough.*"
    - ".*step [0-9]+.*"

content_filters:
  # Skip sections containing these meta-content indicators
  exclude_if_contains:
    - "none"

# Quality filters
quality_filters:
  # Skip sections that are mostly lists/bullets
  max_list_ratio: 0.8    # Increased from 0.7 - allow more lists
  
  # Skip sections with too many code blocks
  max_code_ratio: 0.9    # Increased from 0.8 - allow more code
  
  # Skip sections that are mostly references/citations
  max_citation_ratio: 0.4 # Increased from 0.3 - allow more citations
