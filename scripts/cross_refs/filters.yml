# ML Systems Cross-Reference Section Filters
# ==========================================
# Configuration for excluding sections that don't contain substantive technical content

exclude_sections:
  # Exact title matches (case-insensitive)
  exact:
    - "about"

    - "chapter summary"
    - "conclusion"
    - "getting started"
    - "installation"
    - "introduction"
    - "key takeaways"
    - "learning objectives"
    - "looking ahead"
    - "next steps"
    - "overview"
    - "prerequisites" 
    - "purpose"
    - "references"
    - "setup"
    - "summary"

  # Pattern matching (regex patterns)
  patterns:

    - ".*assignment.*"
    - ".*lab [0-9]+.*"
    - ".*tutorial.*"
    - ".*walkthrough.*"
    - ".*step [0-9]+.*"

# Content-based filtering rules
content_filters:
  min_length: 200        # Skip sections shorter than 200 chars
  max_length: 15000      # Skip extremely long sections (likely auto-generated)
  
  # Skip sections containing these meta-content indicators
  exclude_if_contains:
    - "learning outcome"
    - "this chapter will"
    - "by the end of this"
    - "upon completion"
    - "you will learn"
    - "learning goal"
    - "this section covers"
    - "prerequisite"

    - "installation guide"
    - "setup instruction"
    - "download and install"

# Quality filters
quality_filters:
  # Skip sections that are mostly lists/bullets
  max_list_ratio: 0.7    # If >70% of lines start with - or *, skip
  
  # Skip sections with too many code blocks
  max_code_ratio: 0.8    # If >80% is code, likely not conceptual
  
  # Skip sections that are mostly references/citations
  max_citation_ratio: 0.3 # If >30% is [@citations], skip
