![_DALLÂ·E 3 Prompt: Create a detailed, wide rectangular illustration of an AI workflow. The image should showcase the process across six stages, with a flow from left to right: 1. Data collection, with diverse individuals of different genders and descents using a variety of devices like laptops, smartphones, and sensors to gather data. 2. Data processing, displaying a data center with active servers and databases with glowing lights. 3. Model training, represented by a computer screen with code, neural network diagrams, and progress indicators. 4. Model evaluation, featuring people examining data analytics on large monitors. 5. Deployment, where the AI is integrated into robotics, mobile apps, and industrial equipment. 6. Monitoring, showing professionals tracking AI performance metrics on dashboards to check for accuracy and concept drift over time. Each stage should be distinctly marked and the style should be clean, sleek, and modern with a dynamic and informative color scheme._](./images/cover_ml_ops.png)
