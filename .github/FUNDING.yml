name: "Support Global Access to Open-Source AI Education"
description: |
  This book was created to address the lack of open-source resources in machine learning *systems* education. While this project grew out of my course at Harvard University, it has evolved into something much broader.

  To continue developing and expanding this project as an open source collaborative project, we need support to hire staff and teaching assistants from around the world. As this project extends beyond traditional institutional boundaries, external sponsorship is crucial for its sustainability. By sponsoring this project, you'll be helping to maintain and grow this valuable open-source resource, enabling contributors from diverse backgrounds to participate and improve the content.
