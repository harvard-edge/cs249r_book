# =============================================================================
# NETLIFY PROXY CONFIGURATION FOR GITHUB PAGES
# =============================================================================
# This configuration proxies all requests to GitHub Pages while adding
# Netlify features like custom redirects, headers, and better performance.
#
# Flow: mlsysbook.ai → Netlify → GitHub Pages

# Custom redirects (processed BEFORE proxy)
