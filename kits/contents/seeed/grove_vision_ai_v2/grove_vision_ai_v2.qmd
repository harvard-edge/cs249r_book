# Overview {.unnumbered}

These labs offer an opportunity to gain practical experience with machine learning (ML) systems on a high-end, yet compact, embedded device, the Seeed Studio Grove Vision AI V2. Unlike working with large models requiring data center-scale resources, these labs allow you to interact with hardware and software using TinyML directly. This hands-on approach provides a tangible understanding of the challenges and opportunities in deploying AI, albeit on a small scale. However, the principles are essentially the same as what you would encounter when working with larger or even smaller systems.

The Grove Vision AI V2 occupies a unique position in the embedded AI landscape, bridging the gap between basic microcontroller solutions, such as the Seeed XIAO ESP32S3 Sense or Arduino Nicla Vision, and more powerful single-board computers, like the Raspberry Pi. At its heart lies the Himax WiseEye2 HX6538 processor, featuring a **dual-core Arm Cortex-M55 and an integrated ARM Ethos-U55 neural network unit**.

The Arm Ethos-U55 represents a specialized machine learning processor class, specifically designed as a microNPU to accelerate ML inference in area-constrained embedded and IoT devices. This powerful combination of the Ethos-U55 with the AI-capable Cortex-M55 processor delivers a remarkable 480x uplift in ML performance over existing Cortex-M-based systems. Operating at 400 MHz with configurable internal system memory (SRAM) up to 2.4 MB, the Grove Vision AI V2 offers professional-grade computer vision capabilities while maintaining the power efficiency and compact form factor essential for edge applications.

This positioning makes it an ideal platform for learning advanced TinyML concepts, offering the simplicity and reduced power requirements of smaller systems while providing capabilities that far exceed those of traditional microcontroller-based solutions.

## Where to Buy {#sec-overview-where-to-buy}

The Grove Vision AI V2 is available from Seeed Studio:

- [Grove Vision AI V2 (Seeed Studio)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Vision-AI-Module-V2-p-5851.html) (~$25)

You will also need a compatible camera module (Raspberry Pi OV5647) and optionally a master controller like the XIAO ESP32S3.

## Pre-requisites {#sec-overview-prerequisites-7b1e}

- **Grove Vision AI V2 Board**: Ensure you have the Grove Vision AI V2 Board.
- **Raspberry Pi OV5647 Camera Module**: The camera should be connected to the Grove Vision AI V2 Board for image capture.
- **Master Controller**: Can be a Seeed XIAO ESP32S3, a XIAO ESP32C6, or other devices.
- **USB-C Cable**: This is for connecting the board to your computer.
- **Network**: With internet access for downloading the necessary software.
- **XIAO Expansion Board Base**: This helps connect the Master Device to the Physical World (optional).
