# Getting Started {.unnumbered}

Ready to deploy machine learning on embedded hardware? This guide helps you choose the right platform and get your development environment running.

## Choose Your Hardware

Select a platform based on your budget and learning goals:

| Platform | Price | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| [Grove Vision AI V2](seeed/grove_vision_ai_v2/grove_vision_ai_v2.qmd) | ~$20 | Beginners, plug-and-play vision AI |
| [XIAO ESP32S3](seeed/xiao_esp32s3/xiao_esp32s3.qmd) | ~$25 | Best value, multi-modal sensing |
| [Raspberry Pi](raspi/raspi.qmd) | ~$80 | Advanced users, LLMs and VLMs |
| [Nicla Vision](arduino/nicla_vision/nicla_vision.qmd) | ~$100 | Professional, battery-powered |

## Set Up Your Environment

Development environment setup typically takes 30-60 minutes. Follow the [IDE Setup Guide](ide-setup.qmd) for step-by-step instructions covering:

- Arduino IDE installation for microcontroller platforms
- Python environment setup for Raspberry Pi
- SenseCraft AI web interface for Grove Vision AI V2
- Serial communication and debugging tools

## Available Labs

Each platform supports different exercise types. Choose exercises that match your hardware:

## Prerequisites

**Programming:** Python proficiency required. C/C++ familiarity helpful but not required.

**Math:** Basic linear algebra and probability. No advanced math needed.

**Hardware:** No prior embedded experience assumed. Labs include complete setup procedures.

## Start Building

Once your environment is configured, jump into the labs for your platform:

- **Grove Vision AI V2:** Start with [Setup and No-Code Apps](seeed/grove_vision_ai_v2/setup_and_no_code_apps/setup_and_no_code_apps.qmd) for the fastest path to running AI models
- **XIAO ESP32S3:** Begin with [Setup](seeed/xiao_esp32s3/setup/setup.qmd), then try [Image Classification](seeed/xiao_esp32s3/image_classification/image_classification.qmd)
- **Nicla Vision:** Follow [Setup](arduino/nicla_vision/setup/setup.qmd) to configure your board
- **Raspberry Pi:** Complete [Setup](raspi/setup/setup.qmd), then explore [Image Classification](raspi/image_classification/image_classification.qmd) or jump to [LLMs](raspi/llm/llm.qmd)

Each lab includes implementation procedures, expected results, and troubleshooting guidance.
