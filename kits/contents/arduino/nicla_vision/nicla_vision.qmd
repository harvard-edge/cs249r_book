# Overview {.unnumbered}

These labs provide a unique opportunity to gain practical experience with machine learning (ML) systems. Unlike working with large models requiring data center-scale resources, these exercises allow you to directly interact with hardware and software using TinyML. This hands-on approach gives you a tangible understanding of the challenges and opportunities in deploying AI, albeit at a tiny scale. However, the principles are largely the same as what you would encounter when working with larger systems.
