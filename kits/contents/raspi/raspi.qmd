# Overview {.unnumbered}

These labs offer invaluable hands-on experience with machine learning systems, leveraging the versatility and accessibility of the Raspberry Pi platform. Unlike working with large-scale models that demand extensive cloud resources, these exercises allow you to directly interact with hardware and software in a compact yet powerful edge computing environment. You'll gain practical insights into deploying AI at the edge by utilizing Raspberry Pi's capabilities, from the efficient Pi Zero to the more robust Pi 4 or Pi 5 models. This approach provides a tangible understanding of the challenges and opportunities in implementing machine learning solutions in resource-constrained settings. While we're working at a smaller scale, the principles and techniques you'll learn are fundamentally similar to those used in larger systems. The Raspberry Pi's ability to run a whole operating system and its extensive GPIO capabilities allow for a rich learning experience that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Through these labs, you'll grasp the intricacies of EdgeML and develop skills applicable to a wide range of AI deployment scenarios.
