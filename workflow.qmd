## Overview

An ML workflow is a systematic process that encompasses the development, deployment, and maintenance of ML models. The typical steps involved are:

1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly define the problem you aim to solve with your ML model, whether it's image classification, customer churn prediction, or text generation. This clarity sets the stage for data collection and algorithm selection.
2. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gather a high-quality dataset that accurately represents the problem at hand. Data cleaning and preparation are essential steps, which may include outlier removal, missing value imputation, and feature scaling.
3. **Algorithm Selection**: Choose an ML algorithm that aligns with your data type and problem. Various algorithms have their own pros and cons, making the selection critical.
4. **Model Training**: Train your chosen ML algorithm on the prepared dataset. The duration of this process can vary based on dataset size and complexity.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using a separate test set to gauge its generalization capabilities.
6. **Model Deployment**: Integrate the model into production once its performance meets your criteria. This could involve embedding it into a software application or offering it as a web service.
7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Keep track of the model's performance post-deployment and update it as necessary to adapt to changing real-world conditions.

The ML workflow is iterative, requiring ongoing monitoring and potential adjustments. Additional considerations include:

* **Version Control**: Keep track of code and data changes to reproduce results and revert to earlier versions if needed.
* **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation to allow for workflow understanding and reproduction.
* **Testing**: Rigorously test the workflow to ensure its functionality.
* **Security**: Safeguard your workflow and data, particularly when deploying models in production settings.

## General vs. Embedded AI

The ML workflow serves as a universal guide, applicable across various platforms including cloud-based solutions, edge computing, and tinyML. However, the workflow for Embedded AI introduces unique complexities and challenges, which not only make it a captivating domain but also pave the way for remarkable innovations.

### Resource Optimization
- **General ML Workflow**: Prioritizes model accuracy and performance, often leveraging abundant computational resources in cloud or data center environments.
- **Embedded AI Workflow**: Requires careful planning to optimize model size and computational demands, given the resource constraints of embedded systems. Techniques like model quantization and pruning are crucial.

### Real-time Processing
- **General ML Workflow**: Less emphasis on real-time processing, often relying on batch data processing.
- **Embedded AI Workflow**: Prioritizes real-time data processing, making low latency and quick execution essential, especially in applications like autonomous vehicles and industrial automation.

### Data Management and Privacy
- **General ML Workflow**: Processes data in centralized locations, often necessitating extensive data transfer and focusing on data security during transit and storage.
- **Embedded AI Workflow**: Leverages edge computing to process data closer to its source, reducing data transmission and enhancing privacy through data localization.

### Hardware-Software Integration
- **General ML Workflow**: Typically operates on general-purpose hardware, with software development occurring somewhat independently.
- **Embedded AI Workflow**: Involves a more integrated approach to hardware and software development, often incorporating custom chips or hardware accelerators to achieve optimal performance.
