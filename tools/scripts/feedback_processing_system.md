# MLSysBook Feedback Processing System

## Overview
This document defines our systematic approach for handling textbook feedback issues to ensure consistent, thorough resolution while maintaining high content quality.

## Issue Classification Framework

### Type A: Structural Issues
- **Duplicate headings/sections**
- **Inconsistent section numbering** 
- **Missing cross-references**
- **Broken internal links**

### Type B: Content Issues  
- **Repetitive content patterns**
- **Logical flow problems**
- **Inconsistent terminology**
- **Missing explanations**

### Type C: Technical Issues
- **Code examples not working**
- **Incorrect technical details**
- **Outdated references**
- **Missing dependencies**

### Type D: Editorial Issues
- **Grammar/spelling errors**
- **Formatting inconsistencies**  
- **Style guide violations**
- **Accessibility concerns**

## Standard Processing Workflow

### Phase 1: Issue Analysis (ANALYZE)
1. **Read feedback carefully** - Understand all aspects mentioned
2. **Classify issue type** - Use framework above
3. **Identify scope** - Single file, chapter, or cross-chapter
4. **Locate affected content** - Use codebase search and grep
5. **Assess impact** - How does this affect reader experience?

### Phase 2: Investigation (INVESTIGATE)  
1. **Search for patterns** - Is this issue repeated elsewhere?
2. **Check related content** - Are there similar problems nearby?
3. **Verify claims** - Confirm the feedback is accurate
4. **Identify root cause** - Why did this issue occur?
5. **Plan solution scope** - What needs to be changed?

### Phase 3: Solution Design (DESIGN)
1. **Create todo list** - Break down work into specific tasks
2. **Design fix approach** - How to address root cause
3. **Consider side effects** - What else might be impacted?
4. **Plan verification** - How to confirm fix works
5. **Estimate effort** - Simple fix vs major restructuring

### Phase 4: Implementation (IMPLEMENT)
1. **Make targeted changes** - Address specific issues identified
2. **Test builds** - Ensure chapter/book still compiles
3. **Check for new issues** - Run linting and validation
4. **Verify fix completeness** - Re-read feedback against changes
5. **Document changes** - Clear commit messages

### Phase 5: Verification (VERIFY)
1. **Re-analyze original feedback** - Is every point addressed?
2. **Check for regression** - Did we introduce new problems?
3. **Validate related content** - Are connected sections still coherent?
4. **Test user experience** - Does the fix improve readability?
5. **Confirm build stability** - All formats render correctly

### Phase 6: Documentation (DOCUMENT)
1. **Commit with clear messages** - Use conventional commit format
2. **Update issue with progress** - Link commits properly
3. **Close issue properly** - Comprehensive resolution summary
4. **Update any related docs** - Style guides, processes, etc.
5. **Note lessons learned** - Prevent similar issues

## Quality Checkpoints

### Before Starting
- [ ] Issue is clearly understood
- [ ] Scope is properly identified  
- [ ] Approach is planned
- [ ] Todo list created

### During Implementation
- [ ] Changes are targeted and minimal
- [ ] Each change addresses specific feedback
- [ ] Build tests pass after each major change
- [ ] No new linting errors introduced

### Before Closing
- [ ] All feedback points addressed
- [ ] No repetitive content remains
- [ ] Chapter flows logically
- [ ] Cross-references work
- [ ] Commits are properly linked
- [ ] Issue documentation is complete

## Common Patterns and Solutions

### Duplicate Headings
- **Pattern**: Same heading text appears multiple times
- **Solution**: Rename to be more specific or merge content
- **Check**: Search for similar patterns elsewhere

### Repetitive Content  
- **Pattern**: Same concepts explained multiple times
- **Solution**: Consolidate explanations, keep only necessary mentions
- **Check**: Each mention serves distinct purpose

### Flow Issues
- **Pattern**: Logical sequence doesn't make sense
- **Solution**: Reorder sections or add transitions
- **Check**: Reader can follow progression naturally

### Technical Inconsistencies
- **Pattern**: Conflicting information or outdated details
- **Solution**: Update to current standards, ensure consistency
- **Check**: All technical details are accurate and current

## Tools and Commands

### Investigation Tools
```bash
# Find duplicate headings
grep "^##.*{#" file.qmd | sort | uniq -d

# Search for repetitive patterns  
grep -i "pattern.*text" file.qmd

# Check cross-references
grep "@.*-ref" file.qmd

# Validate builds
quarto render file.qmd --to html
```

### Quality Assurance
```bash
# Check linting
gh workflow run validate-dev.yml

# Test specific chapter
cd quarto && quarto render contents/core/chapter/chapter.qmd

# Verify links
# (Use appropriate link checker)
```
