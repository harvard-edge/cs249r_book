        replacement_text: "Building on the robustness foundations established in @sec-robust-ai for hardware faults, adversarial attacks, and distribution shifts, machine learning systems require additional security and privacy protections beyond traditional computational systems. While robust AI addresses system resilience against faults and adversarial inputs, security and privacy encompass broader concerns including data protection, model confidentiality, and regulatory compliance."
        context_check: "Verify this appears in the Overview section before discussing ML system architectures"

        current_text: "Adversarial attacks exploit the learned decision boundaries of neural networks to craft inputs that cause misclassification. These attacks manipulate input data in ways that are often imperceptible to humans but lead models to produce incorrect outputs."

        result_verification: "Confirm the text now references robust AI chapter and focuses on security implications rather than repeating basic mechanisms"

      - action: "Bridge historical incidents to ML threats more smoothly"
        location_method: "Search for 'However, machine learning introduces attack vectors absent from traditional computing' in From Historical Lessons section"
        current_text: "However, machine learning introduces attack vectors absent from traditional computing. Rather than exploiting buffer overflows or SQL injection vulnerabilities, adversaries can manipulate training data to embed backdoors, craft adversarial inputs that exploit learned decision boundaries, or extract proprietary models through systematic API queries."
        replacement_text: "While these historical incidents involved traditional attack vectors (buffer overflows, SQL injection), machine learning systems face additional risks that exploit the data-driven nature of learning algorithms. The same architectural vulnerabilities—supply chain compromise, insufficient isolation, and weaponized endpoints—now enable novel attacks: manipulating training data to embed backdoors (extending supply chain risks to datasets), crafting adversarial inputs that exploit learned decision boundaries (turning model interfaces into attack surfaces), and extracting proprietary models through systematic API queries (weaponizing inference endpoints for intellectual property theft)."

        current_text: "Security and privacy, although closely related, address distinct aspects of protection. A secure system prevents unauthorized access to a facial recognition model, while a privacy-preserving system ensures the model doesn't memorize or leak individual faces from training data. Security focuses on ensuring system integrity and availability in the presence of adversaries. Privacy emphasizes the control and protection of sensitive information, even in the absence of active attacks."
        replacement_text: "Security and privacy represent complementary but distinct protection goals detailed in the formal definitions below (@sec-security-privacy-definitions-distinctions-8f62). Understanding their interaction is essential for ML systems that must simultaneously prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data."

        text_to_add: "## Threat Prioritization Framework {#sec-security-privacy-threat-prioritization}\n\nBefore examining defensive strategies, practitioners need a systematic approach to prioritize threats based on deployment context, risk tolerance, and available resources. Cloud deployments face different threat profiles than edge devices; healthcare applications prioritize data privacy while autonomous vehicles emphasize inference integrity. The following framework guides threat assessment:\n\n**Asset Criticality**: Rank protected assets (training data, model IP, inference outputs) by business and regulatory importance. **Attack Likelihood**: Assess adversary motivation and capability for each threat vector. **Impact Severity**: Evaluate consequences of successful attacks on system operation and user trust. **Defense Cost**: Consider computational overhead, development complexity, and operational burden of countermeasures.\n\nThis prioritization informs the layered defense strategies that follow."
