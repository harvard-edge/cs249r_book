## Why We Wrote This Book {.unnumbered}

**The Problem:** Students learn to train AI models, but few understand how to build the systems that actually make them work in production.

When ML systems concepts are taught, students often learn individual components without grasping the holistic architecture‚Äîthey can see the trees but miss the forest. 

**The Future:** As AI becomes more autonomous, the critical bottleneck won't be just the algorithms‚Äîit will be the AI engineers who can build efficient, scalable, and sustainable systems.

```{=html}

  "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."
  <footer>‚Äî African Proverb</footer>
</blockquote>
```

**Our Approach:** This vision emerged from collaborative work in **CS249r at Harvard University**, where students, faculty, and industry partners came together to explore the systems side of ML. The content was developed through real student contributions during Fall 2023. What started as class notes has turned into a comprehensive educational resource we now share globally.
