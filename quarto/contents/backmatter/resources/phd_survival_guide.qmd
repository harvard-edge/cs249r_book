# PhD Survival Guide {.unnumbered}

Technical knowledge in machine learning systems or be it in any other field, while essential, is only one dimension of successful research and scholarship. The journey through (graduate) school and beyond demands a broader set of skills: the ability to read and synthesize complex literature, communicate ideas effectively, manage time, and navigate academic careers thoughtfully.

This appendix is a small set of resources that address these important but often underdiscussed aspects of academic life. The curated materials span from seminal works that have guided multiple generations of researchers to contemporary discussions of productivity and scientific communication.

Many of these resources originated in computer science and engineering contexts, with each section focusing on a distinct aspect of academic life and presenting authoritative sources that have proven particularly valuable for graduate students and early-career researchers.
