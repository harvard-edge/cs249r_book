_This part establishes the core concepts necessary for understanding machine learning systems. It begins with a high-level overview of the field, including the motivation for a systems-oriented approach to machine learning. Subsequent chapters introduce the fundamentals of machine learning, deep learning architectures, and the computational framing used throughout the textbook. These chapters provide the terminology, abstractions, and technical background that will be built upon in later parts of the book._
