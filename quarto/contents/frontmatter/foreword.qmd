# Author's Note {.unnumbered}

::: {style="font-style: italic;"}

AI is bound to transform the world in profound ways, much like computers and the Internet revolutionized every aspect of society in the 20th century. From systems that generate creative content like text and images to those driving breakthroughs in drug discovery and scientific research, AI is ushering in a new era—one that promises to be even more transformative in its scope and impact. But how do we make it accessible to everyone?

With its transformative power comes an equally great responsibility for those who access it or work with it. Just as we expect companies to wield their influence ethically, those of us in academia bear a parallel responsibility: to share our knowledge openly, so it benefits everyone—not just a select few. This conviction inspired the creation of this book—an open-source resource aimed at making AI education, particularly in AI engineering and systems, inclusive, and accessible to everyone from all walks of life.

My passion for creating, curating, and editing this content has been deeply influenced by landmark textbooks that have profoundly shaped both my academic and personal journey. Whether I studied them cover to cover or drew insights from key passages, these resources fundamentally shaped the way I think. I reflect on the books that guided my path: works by Turing Award winners such as David Patterson and John Hennessy—pioneers in computer architecture and system design—and foundational research papers by luminaries like Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio, who pioneered modern deep learning. In some small part, my hope is that this book will inspire students to chart their own unique paths.

I am optimistic about what lies ahead for AI. It has the potential to solve global challenges and unlock creativity in ways we have yet to imagine. To achieve this, however, we must train the next generation of AI engineers and practitioners—those who can transform novel AI algorithms into scalable, reliable systems that work in real-world environments. This book is a step toward curating the material needed to build the next generation of AI engineers who will transform today's visions into tomorrow's reality.

This book is a work in progress, but knowing that even one learner benefits from its content motivates me to continually refine and expand it. To that end, if there's one thing I ask of readers, it's this: please show your support by starring the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book). Your star ⭐ reflects your belief in this mission—not just to me, but to the growing global community of learners, educators, and practitioners. This small act is more than symbolic—it amplifies the importance of making AI education accessible.

I am a student of my own writing, and every chapter of this book has taught me something new—thanks to the numerous people who have played, and continue to play, an important role in shaping this work. Professors, students, practitioners, and researchers contributed by offering suggestions, sharing expertise, identifying errors, and proposing improvements. Every interaction, from detailed critiques to simple corrections, has been a lesson in collaborative knowledge creation. These contributions have not only refined the material but also deepened my understanding of how knowledge grows through collaboration. This book is, therefore, not solely my work; it is a shared endeavor, reflecting the collective spirit of those dedicated to sharing their knowledge and effort.

This book is dedicated to the loving memory of my father. His passion for education, endless curiosity, generosity in sharing knowledge, and unwavering commitment to quality challenge me daily to strive for excellence in all I do. In his honor, I extend this dedication to teachers and mentors everywhere, whose efforts and guidance transform lives every day. Your selfless contributions remind me to persevere.

Last but certainly not least, this work would not be possible without the unwavering support of my wonderful wife and children. Their love, patience, and encouragement form the foundation that enables me to pursue my passion and bring this work to life. For this, and so much more, I am deeply grateful.
