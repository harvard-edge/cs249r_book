For example, edge ML reduces latency by processing data close to the source, while mobile ML balances performance with battery life. This shift highlights the need for context-aware system designs that address specific operational requirements.",

            "answer": "Hybrid ML architectures can leverage cloud capabilities for intensive training tasks and use edge deployments for real-time inference, balancing computation power with latency and privacy needs. For example, cloud-based training can handle large datasets and complex models, while edge inference provides quick responses by processing data locally, reducing latency and enhancing privacy.",
