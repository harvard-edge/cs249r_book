This is crucial because ML models can degrade over time without obvious errors, leading to plausible but incorrect outputs that traditional monitoring might miss. For example, a model might gradually become less accurate as data distribution shifts, which can be detected by monitoring performance variance.",

This is important because it ensures the system can handle real user behavior, including request spikes and sustained high-throughput operations, while maintaining performance and meeting latency requirements. For example, simulating a sudden increase in user requests helps evaluate system scalability and responsiveness.",
