    Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently widely used for many artificial intelligence (AI)
    applications including computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics. While DNNs deliver
    state-of-the-art accuracy on many AI tasks, it comes at the cost of high computational
    complexity. Accordingly, techniques that enable efficient processing of DNNs to improve energy
    efficiency and throughput without sacrificing application accuracy or increasing hardware cost
    are critical to the wide deployment of DNNs in AI systems. This article aims to provide a
    comprehensive tutorial and survey about the recent advances towards the goal of enabling
    efficient processing of DNNs. Specifically, it will provide an overview of DNNs, discuss
    various hardware platforms and architectures that support DNNs, and highlight key trends in
    reducing the computation cost of DNNs either solely via hardware design changes or via joint
    hardware design and DNN algorithm changes. It will also summarize various development resources
    that enable researchers and practitioners to quickly get started in this field, and highlight
    important benchmarking metrics and design considerations that should be used for evaluating the
    rapidly growing number of DNN hardware designs, optionally including algorithmic co-designs,
    being proposed in academia and industry. The reader will take away the following concepts from
    this article: understand the key design considerations for DNNs; be able to evaluate different
    DNN hardware implementations with benchmarks and comparison metrics; understand the trade-offs
    between various hardware architectures and platforms; be able to evaluate the utility of
    various DNN design techniques for efficient processing; and understand recent implementation
    trends and opportunities.
