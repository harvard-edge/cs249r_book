            "answer": "Tailoring ML systems for social good to specific constraints is crucial because these systems often operate under severe limitations such as limited power, unreliable connectivity, and sparse data. Adapting to these constraints ensures that the systems can function effectively and deliver meaningful outcomes in underserved communities.",
