Instead, it provides a high-level synthesis of the chapter's content, which is typically not suitable for self-check questions. The section does not present design tradeoffs or build on previous knowledge in a way that needs reinforcement through a quiz. Therefore, a self-check is not pedagogically valuable for this section."
