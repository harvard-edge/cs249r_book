    Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from
    domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit
    (TPU) --- deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural
    networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a
    peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip
    memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile
    response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of
    CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such
    features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively
    small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80
    GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the
    high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that
    represent 95
