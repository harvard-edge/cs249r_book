            "answer": "Tools like PyTorchFI and Fidelity simulate fault scenarios and assess vulnerabilities, allowing researchers to systematically improve system resilience. For example, they can model hardware faults or adversarial attacks, helping to identify weaknesses and implement robust solutions. This is important because it translates theoretical robustness principles into practical safeguards.",

            "answer": "To address adversarial examples, implement adversarial training by including adversarially perturbed inputs during training to improve model robustness. Additionally, use detection mechanisms to identify and filter out adversarial inputs in real-time. This is important to maintain model accuracy and reliability in the presence of malicious inputs.",
