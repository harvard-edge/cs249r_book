            "choices": [
              "Increased reliance on traditional data processing methods",
              "Decreased need for data privacy measures",
              "Greater emphasis on scalability and efficiency",
              "Reduced importance of model interpretability"
            ],
            "answer": "The correct answer is C. Greater emphasis on scalability and efficiency. Emerging trends in ML systems often focus on improving scalability and efficiency to handle larger datasets and more complex models. A is incorrect because emerging trends often move away from traditional methods. C and D are incorrect as data privacy and interpretability remain important.",
