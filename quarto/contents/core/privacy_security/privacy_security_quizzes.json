            "answer": "Distributed ML systems introduce new security challenges because they operate across heterogeneous environments, such as edge devices and federated networks, which expand the attack surface. These systems require coordination across different nodes, complicating the implementation of comprehensive security measures. For example, edge nodes may be more vulnerable to physical tampering, and federated learning can expose data through model updates.

            "answer": "To address privacy vulnerabilities in a production system, one might implement differential privacy techniques to ensure that individual data points are not easily extracted from model parameters. For example, adding noise to the training data or model outputs can obscure the contribution of any single data point. Additionally, secure multi-party computation or federated learning can be used to keep data localized while still benefiting from collective learning.
