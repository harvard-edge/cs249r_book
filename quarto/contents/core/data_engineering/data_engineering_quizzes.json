            "answer": "Training-serving consistency ensures that the data transformations applied during model training are identical to those during serving. This consistency is crucial because discrepancies can lead to significant performance degradation in production. For example, if a transformation is applied differently during serving, the model may make incorrect predictions. This is important because it directly affects the reliability and accuracy of the ML system in real-world applications.",

            "answer": "The correct order is: (2) Data acquisition, (3) Data storage, (1) Data governance. Data acquisition is the first step where raw data is collected. Next, data storage involves organizing and storing the data efficiently. Finally, data governance ensures that the data is managed and used in compliance with regulations and best practices. This sequence is important for establishing a robust data pipeline.",

            "question": "In a production system, what trade-offs would you consider when implementing a tiered storage strategy?",
            "answer": "When implementing a tiered storage strategy, you must balance performance requirements against economic constraints. For example, high-performance storage tiers are more expensive but necessary for latency-sensitive operations, while lower-cost tiers can be used for archival purposes. This is important because optimizing storage costs while maintaining system performance is critical for sustainable ML operations.",
