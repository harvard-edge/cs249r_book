foundations: >
  This part establishes the core concepts necessary for understanding machine learning systems. 
  It begins with a high-level overview of the field, including the motivation for a systems-oriented 
  approach to machine learning. Subsequent chapters introduce the fundamentals of machine learning, 
  deep learning architectures, and the computational framing used throughout the textbook.

best practices: >
  This part examines how machine learning systems are deployed and maintained in real-world settings. 
  Topics include system operations, on-device learning, privacy and security, sustainability, and robustness. 
  The chapters highlight common challenges encountered during deployment and outline best practices for 
  managing system behavior across diverse and dynamic environments. The material emphasizes engineering 
  decisions that affect reliability, fairness, and long-term maintainability.

design principles: >
  This part focuses on the architectural and design principles that underpin the development of machine 
  learning systems. It examines the full ML workflow, from data engineering and training methodologies 
  to the design and implementation of software frameworks that coordinate computational graphs and interface 
  with underlying hardware. The chapters also address optimization strategies for computational efficiency, 
  hardware-aware system design, and the role of benchmarking in evaluating system performance. Together, 
  these topics form the basis for building ML systems that are modular, efficient, and scalable across a range 
  of deployment scenarios.

impact and outlook: >
  The final part reflects on the broader implications of machine learning systems. It explores applications 
  that serve the public good and considers how system design choices influence social outcomes. 
  The concluding chapter synthesizes lessons from across the book and offers guidance on future directions 
  in the field. This part encourages readers to critically assess the societal context of ML systems and 
  to consider their role as engineers and stewards of technology.
