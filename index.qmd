# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to {{< var title.long >}}. This book is your gateway to the fast-paced world of AI systems through the lens of embedded systems. It is an extension of the course TinyML from [CS249r](https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/cs249-tinyml-2023) at Harvard University.

We aim to make this open-source book a collaborative effort that brings together insights from students, professionals, and the broader community of applied machine learning practitioners. We want to create a one-stop guide that dives deep into the nuts and bolts of AI systems and their many uses.

This isn't just a static textbook; it's a living, breathing document. We're making it open-source and continually updated to meet the ever-changing needs of this dynamic field. Expect a rich blend of expert knowledge that guides you through the complex interplay between cutting-edge algorithms and the foundational principles that make them work. We're setting the stage for the next big leap in tech innovation.

# Why We Wrote This Book

We're in an age where technology is always evolving. Open collaboration and sharing knowledge are the building blocks of true innovation. That's the spirit behind {{< var title.long >}}. We go beyond the traditional textbook model to create a living knowledge hub. 

The book covers principles, algorithms, and real-world application case studies, aiming to give you a deep understanding that will help you navigate the ever-changing landscape of embedded AI. By keeping it open, we're not just making learning accessible but inviting new ideas and ongoing improvements. In short, we're building a community where knowledge is free to grow and light the way forward in global embedded AI tech.

# What You'll Need to Know

To dive into this book, you don't need to be a machine learning whiz. All you need is a basic understanding of systems and a curiosity to explore how embedded hardware, AI, and software come together. This is where innovation happens, and a basic grasp of how systems work will be your compass.

We're also focusing on the exciting overlaps between these fields, aiming to create a learning environment where traditional boundaries fade away, making room for a more holistic, integrated view of modern tech. Your interest in embedded AI and low-level software will guide you through a rich and rewarding learning experience.
