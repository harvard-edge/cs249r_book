# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Machine Learning Systems, your gateway to the fast-paced world of machine learning (ML) systems. This book is an extension of the [CS249r](https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/cs249-tinyml-2023) course at Harvard University, taught by Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi, and is the result of a collaborative effort involving students, professionals, and the broader community of AI practitioners.

We've created this open-source book to demystify the process of building efficient and scalable ML systems. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive guide that covers the principles, practices, and challenges of developing robust ML pipelines for deployment. This isn't a static textbookâ€”it's a living, evolving resource designed to keep pace with advancements in the field.

This book connects foundational principles with practical workflows, guiding you through concepts like data collection, model design, optimization, acceleration, and security hardening, all from a systems perspective. Whether you're a student, practitioner, or researcher, we hope you find value in this dynamic, community-driven resource.

## Why We Wrote This Book

In a world where technology is constantly evolving, open collaboration and shared knowledge are essential for innovation. This book goes beyond the traditional textbook model to serve as a living knowledge hub, inviting contributions and fostering a global community of learners and innovators.

By focusing on the principles and practices of ML systems, we aim to help you navigate the complexities of deploying and maintaining AI solutions. Together, let's explore the potential of machine learning to transform industries and improve lives.
