# Hardware Kits {.unnumbered}

This page introduces the hardware platforms chosen for our TinyML curriculum. TinyML—machine learning on resource-constrained, embedded devices—serves as an effective context for teaching the full spectrum of machine learning systems engineering. By working with these platforms, students confront real-world challenges such as limited compute, memory, and power, as well as the integration of sensors and actuators, and the practicalities of deploying and maintaining models outside traditional data centers.

Cost and accessibility are central to our hardware choices. We have selected platforms across a range of price points, from affordable development boards to more advanced kits, and offer guidance on educational discounts and alternative sources to help make hands-on embedded ML experience widely attainable. Our aim is to lower barriers so that as many learners as possible can engage with embedded ML in a practical, meaningful way.

## Curriculum Design Philosophy {#sec-kits-curriculum-philosophy}

Our hardware selection is guided by pedagogical principles that promote both breadth and depth in embedded machine learning. Platforms are chosen to offer **progressive complexity**, enabling learners to start with accessible tools and advance to more sophisticated systems as their confidence grows.

We intentionally include **diverse architectures**—from microcontrollers to application processors and dedicated AI accelerators—so students can see how hardware constraints and capabilities shape design decisions. This exposure ranges from ultra-low-power devices to powerful edge computers.

**Accessibility** is prioritized, with kit recommendations spanning a wide price range to accommodate different budgets. We also provide information on discounts and alternative sources.

All selected platforms are used in commercial products, ensuring that the skills developed in our labs are directly relevant to professional practice. Each platform is supported by a robust development ecosystem, including comprehensive toolchains, documentation, and active community support.
