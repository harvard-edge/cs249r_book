# Hardware Kits {.unnumbered}

This page provides a comprehensive overview of the hardware platforms we've carefully selected for our TinyML curriculum. Each kit represents a different approach to embedded machine learning, offering unique capabilities and learning opportunities.

## Curriculum Design Philosophy {#sec-kits-curriculum-philosophy}

Our hardware selection follows key pedagogical principles that ensure students gain both breadth and depth in embedded machine learning. We've chosen platforms that provide **progressive complexity**, moving from simple sensor integration to advanced neural processing units. This approach allows learners to build confidence with accessible tools before tackling more sophisticated systems.

The platforms represent **diverse architectures** spanning microcontrollers, application processors, and dedicated AI accelerators. This diversity is intentional—real-world ML deployment requires understanding how different hardware constraints and capabilities influence design decisions. Students experience everything from ultra-low-power microcontrollers running for months on a battery to powerful edge computers capable of running transformer models.

**Accessibility** remains paramount in our selection. Our kit recommendations range from $10 development boards to $200 comprehensive systems, ensuring that cost doesn't become a barrier to learning. We provide guidance for educational discounts and alternative sources to support students with varying budgets.

Each platform we've selected sees actual **real-world deployment** in commercial products, ensuring that skills learned in our labs transfer directly to professional practice. Finally, all platforms benefit from **strong development ecosystems** with comprehensive toolchains, extensive documentation, and active community support.
