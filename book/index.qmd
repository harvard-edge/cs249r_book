Machine Learning Systems provides a systematic framework for understanding and engineering machine learning (ML) systems. This textbook bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and practical engineering, emphasizing the systems perspective required to build effective AI solutions. Unlike resources that focus primarily on algorithms and model architectures, this book highlights the broader context in which ML systems operate, including data engineering, model optimization, hardware-aware training, and inference acceleration. Readers will develop the ability to reason about ML system architectures and apply enduring engineering principles for building flexible, efficient, and robust machine learning systems.

This book grew out of the collaborative work in CS249r at Harvard University, where students, faculty, and industry partners came together to explore the systems side of machine learning. While there are plenty of resources that focus on the algorithmic side of machine learning, resources on the systems side of things are few and far between. This gap inspired us to create this book‚Äîa resource dedicated to the principles and practices of building efficient and scalable ML systems.

Our vision for this book and its broader mission is deeply rooted in the transformative potential of AI and the need to make AI education globally accessible to all. To learn more about the inspiration behind this project and the values driving its creation, we encourage you to read the [Author's Note](contents/frontmatter/foreword.qmd).
