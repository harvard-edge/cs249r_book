## Learning Goals {#sec-book-learning-goals-4827}

This section outlines the educational framework guiding the book's design and the specific learning objectives readers will achieve.

### Key Learning Outcomes {#sec-book-key-learning-outcomes-f103}

This book is structured with [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/) in mind (@fig-bloom), which defines six levels of learning, ranging from foundational knowledge to advanced creative thinking:

![Bloom's Taxonomy (2021 edition).](images/png/bloom_revised_taxonomy.png){#fig-bloom}

1. **Remembering**: Recalling basic facts and concepts.

2. **Understanding**: Explaining ideas or processes.

3. **Applying**: Using knowledge in new situations.

4. **Analyzing**: Breaking down information into components.

5. **Evaluating**: Making judgments based on criteria and standards.

6. **Creating**: Producing original work or solutions.

### Learning Objectives {#sec-book-learning-objectives-068b}

This book supports readers in developing practical expertise across the ML systems lifecycle:

1. **Systems Thinking**: Understand how ML systems differ from traditional software and reason about hardware-software interactions.

2. **Workflow Engineering**: Design end-to-end ML pipelines, from data engineering through deployment and maintenance.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Apply systematic approaches to make systems faster, smaller, and more resource-efficient.

4. **Production Deployment**: Address real-world challenges including reliability, security, privacy, and scalability.

5. **Responsible Development**: Navigate ethical implications and implement sustainable, socially beneficial AI systems.

6. **Future-Ready Skills**: Develop judgment to evaluate emerging technologies and adapt to evolving paradigms.

7. **Hands-On Implementation**: Gain practical experience across diverse embedded platforms and resource constraints.

8. **Self-Directed Learning**: Use integrated assessments and interactive tools to track progress and deepen understanding.

### AI Learning Companion {#sec-book-ai-learning-companion-df6c}

Throughout this resource, you'll find **SocratiQ**—an AI learning assistant designed to enhance your learning experience. Inspired by the Socratic method of teaching, SocratiQ combines interactive quizzes, personalized assistance, and real-time feedback to help you reinforce your understanding and create new connections. As part of our experiment with Generative AI technologies, SocratiQ encourages critical thinking and active engagement with the material.

SocratiQ is still a work in progress, and we welcome your feedback to make it better. For more details about how SocratiQ works and how to get the most out of it, visit the [AI Learning Companion page](../socratiq/socratiq.qmd).

## How to Use This Book {#sec-book-use-book-bd7c}

### Book Structure {#sec-book-book-structure-8155}

This book takes you from understanding ML systems conceptually to building and deploying them in practice. Each part develops specific capabilities:

**Core Content:**

1. **Systems Foundations**
   *Master the fundamentals.* Build intuition for how ML systems differ from traditional software, understand the hardware-software stack, and gain fluency with essential architectures and mathematical foundations.

2. **Design Principles** 
   *Engineer complete workflows.* Learn to design end-to-end ML pipelines, manage complex data engineering challenges, select appropriate frameworks, and orchestrate training at scale.

3. **Performance Engineering**
   *Optimize for real constraints.* Develop skills to make systems faster, smaller, and more efficient through model optimization, hardware acceleration, and systematic performance analysis.

4. **Robust Deployment**
   *Build production-ready systems.* Address the challenges that make or break real deployments: operational reliability, security vulnerabilities, privacy requirements, and system maintenance.

5. **Ethical AI Systems**
   *Design responsibly.* Navigate the social and environmental implications of ML systems, implement responsible AI practices, and create technology that serves the public good.

6. **Frontiers of ML Systems**
   *Prepare for what's next.* Understand emerging paradigms, anticipate future challenges, and develop the judgment to evaluate new technologies as they emerge.

- **Interactive quizzes** for self-assessment and knowledge reinforcement
- **Practical exercises** connecting theory to implementation  
- **Laboratory experiences** providing hands-on platform-specific learning

We embrace an iterative approach to content development—sharing valuable insights as they become available rather than waiting for perfection. Your feedback helps us continuously improve and refine this resource.

We also build upon the excellent work of experts in the field, fostering a collaborative learning ecosystem where knowledge is shared, extended, and collectively advanced.

## Transparency and Collaboration {#sec-book-transparency-collaboration-db62}

This book began as a community-driven project shaped by the collective efforts of students in CS249r, colleagues at Harvard and beyond, and the broader ML systems community. Its content has evolved through open collaboration, thoughtful feedback, and modern editing tools—including both rule-based scripts and generative AI technologies. In a fitting twist, the very systems we study in this book have helped refine its pages, highlighting the interplay between human expertise and machine intelligence. Fortunately, they're not quite ready to engineer the systems themselves---_at least, not yet._

As the primary author, editor, and curator, I (Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi) provide human-in-the-loop oversight to ensure the textbook material remains accurate, relevant, and of the highest quality. Still, no one is perfect—so errors may exist. Your feedback is welcome and encouraged. This collaborative model is essential for maintaining quality and ensuring that knowledge remains open, evolving, and globally accessible.
