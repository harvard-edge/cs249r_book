# Overview {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the hands-on laboratory component of our Machine Learning Systems curriculum. These labs bridge the critical gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation, offering you direct experience with the challenges and opportunities of deploying AI in real-world systems.

## Pedagogical Approach {#sec-overview-pedagogical-approach}

### Why Hands-On Learning Matters {#sec-overview-why-hands-on}

**Experiential Learning** transforms abstract concepts into concrete understanding through direct manipulation of hardware and software systems. When you see a machine learning model struggle with limited memory or witness inference latency impact user experience, theoretical knowledge becomes visceral understanding.

**Scientific Method** application mirrors real engineering workflows through hypothesis formation, experimentation, and analysis. You'll develop the systematic thinking that distinguishes successful engineers from those who rely on trial and error.

**Immediate Feedback** reveals the direct impact of algorithmic choices on system performance, power consumption, and accuracy. This immediate cause-and-effect relationship accelerates learning far beyond what's possible through simulation or theoretical study alone.

**Theory-Practice Bridge** connects mathematical models with physical constraints and real-world deployment challenges. You'll discover how elegant algorithms must adapt to messy realities like noisy sensors, limited bandwidth, and unpredictable user behavior.

### Learning Taxonomy {#sec-overview-learning-taxonomy}

Our labs follow Bloom's Taxonomy, progressing from basic knowledge to creative synthesis. You'll begin by recalling TinyML concepts and deployment procedures, building the foundational knowledge necessary for more complex work. As you progress, you'll explain why certain design choices are made for embedded systems, developing the conceptual understanding that enables independent problem-solving.

The application phase focuses on implementing ML models on resource-constrained devices, where you'll discover how theoretical knowledge translates into working systems. Analysis activities help you evaluate trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and power consumption‚Äîthe fundamental tensions that define embedded ML system design.

Evaluation exercises develop your ability to judge the suitability of different approaches for specific applications, while creation challenges invite you to design novel solutions for embedded ML deployment challenges. This progression ensures you develop both the technical skills and critical thinking abilities needed for professional practice.

## Learning Objectives {#sec-overview-learning-objectives}

### Core Competencies {#sec-overview-core-competencies}

By completing these laboratories, you will develop essential skills in:

:::{.callout-tip title="Systems Thinking"}
You'll develop a holistic understanding of how hardware constraints, software optimization, and algorithmic choices interact in complex ways. Rather than seeing these as separate concerns, you'll learn to balance competing requirements like accuracy versus speed versus power consumption. This end-to-end perspective spans from model training through deployment to maintenance, giving you the broad view needed to architect successful ML systems.

## Educational Philosophy {#sec-overview-educational-philosophy}

### Learning by Building {#sec-overview-learning-by-building}

Rather than passive consumption of information, these labs emphasize **active construction** of working systems. You'll start simple with fundamental concepts using accessible tools, ensuring everyone can participate regardless of prior hardware experience. Rapid iteration cycles of implementation, testing, and refinement mirror professional development practices while accelerating learning through immediate feedback.

As your confidence grows, you'll scale complexity from basic inference to sophisticated multi-modal systems. Throughout this progression, deep reflection helps you analyze results and connect observations to theoretical foundations, building the conceptual understanding that enables innovation.

### Failure as Learning {#sec-overview-failure-as-learning}

We embrace an **engineering mindset** that treats failures as learning opportunities rather than setbacks. When your model doesn't converge, your sensor readings are noisy, or your system crashes, these become valuable data points for understanding system behavior.

**Debugging skills** develop through systematic approaches to identifying and resolving issues. You'll learn to form hypotheses about failure modes, design experiments to test them, and iterate toward solutions. This process builds resilience and confidence that serves you well when facing unfamiliar challenges.

**Real-world preparation** comes from experiencing the iterative nature of engineering development. Professional systems rarely work perfectly on the first attempt, and learning to navigate setbacks with systematic problem-solving distinguishes successful engineers.

## Laboratory Structure {#sec-overview-lab-structure}

### Pedagogical Progression {#sec-overview-pedagogical-progression}

Each laboratory follows a carefully designed learning sequence:

Parameter exploration through systematic variation of key variables helps you understand system behavior. Hypothesis testing activities teach you to form and test predictions about system behavior, developing the scientific thinking crucial for independent work. Structured data collection approaches ensure you gather meaningful performance measurements.

#### 4. **Critical Analysis** üìä
Results interpretation helps you understand what the data reveals about system behavior beyond surface-level observations. Trade-off evaluation develops your ability to analyze competing design choices, while limitation recognition teaches you to identify constraints and failure modes that inform future design decisions.
