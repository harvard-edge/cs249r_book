## What This Is

The ML Systems textbook teaches you how to engineer AI systems that work in the real world. It bridges machine learning theory with systems engineering practice, covering everything from neural network fundamentals to production deployment.

This directory contains the textbook source and build system for contributors.

## What You Will Learn

| ML Concepts | Systems Engineering |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Neural networks and deep learning | Memory hierarchies and caching |
| Model architectures (CNNs, Transformers) | Hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, NPUs) |
| Training and optimization | Distributed systems and parallelism |
| Inference and deployment | Power and thermal management |
| Compression and quantization | Latency, throughput, and efficiency |

### The ML ↔ Systems Bridge

| You know... | You will learn... |
|-------------|-------------------|
| How to train a model | How training scales across GPU clusters |
| That quantization shrinks models | How INT8 math maps to silicon |
| What a transformer is | Why KV-cache dominates memory |
| Models run on GPUs | How schedulers balance latency vs throughput |
| Edge devices have limits | How to co-design models and hardware |

### Book Structure

| Part | Focus | Chapters |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Foundations** | ML and systems basics | Introduction, ML Primer, DL Primer, AI Acceleration |
| **Workflow** | Production pipeline | Workflows, Data Engineering, Frameworks |
| **Training** | Learning at scale | Training, Distributed Training, Efficient AI |
| **Deployment** | Real-world systems | Inference, On-Device AI, Hardware Benchmarking, Ops |
| **Advanced** | Frontier topics | Privacy, Security, Responsible AI, Sustainable AI, Genertic AI, Frontiers |

## What Makes This Book Different

**Systems first**: Start with hardware constraints and work up to algorithms, not the other way around.

**Production focus**: Every concept connects to real deployment scenarios, not just research benchmarks.

**Open and evolving**: Community-driven updates keep content current with a fast-moving field.

**Hands-on companion**: Pair with [TinyTorch](../tinytorch/) to build what you learn from scratch.
