{"title":"Preface","markdown":{"headingText":"Preface","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nWelcome to Machine Learning Systems, your gateway to the fast-paced world of machine learning (ML) systems. This two-volume work is an extension of the [CS249r](https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/cs249-tinyml-2023) course at Harvard University, expanding from TinyML to broader ML systems topics, taught by Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi, and is the result of a collaborative effort involving students, professionals, and the broader community of AI practitioners.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html:js\"}\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"../../github-button.html\" title=\"GitHub repository link\" aria-label=\"Link to the book's GitHub repository for contributions and issues\"></iframe>\n```\n:::\n\nWe created this open-source textbook for students and practitioners to demystify the process of building efficient and scalable ML systems. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive guide that covers the principles, practices, and challenges of developing robust ML pipelines for deployment. Volume I establishes foundational concepts and core engineering practices, while Volume II extends into advanced topics including distributed systems, production deployment at scale, and responsible AI. This is not a static textbook but a living, evolving resource designed to keep pace with advancements in the field.\n\n> \"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\"\n> -- African Proverb\n\nThis book connects foundational principles with practical workflows from a systems engineering perspective. You'll learn about data collection, model design, optimization, acceleration, and security hardening, all focused on real-world deployment challenges.\n\nAfter working through these volumes, you will be able to design ML training pipelines, optimize models for deployment, and debug production ML systems. Whether you are a computer science student learning ML systems, an engineer deploying AI in production, or a researcher building novel architectures, this community-driven resource will guide your journey.\n\n## Why We Wrote This Work {#sec-preface-wrote-book-9fb6}\n\nIn a world where technology is constantly evolving, open collaboration and shared knowledge are essential for innovation. Unlike traditional textbooks that become outdated quickly, this work serves as a living knowledge hub that evolves with the field, inviting contributions and fostering a global community of learners and innovators.\n\nBy focusing on the principles and practices of ML systems engineering, we aim to help you build the skills needed to deploy and maintain AI solutions at scale. Together, let us explore the potential of machine learning to transform industries and improve lives.\n\n## Want to Help Out? {#sec-preface-want-help-ec2e}\n\nThis is a collaborative project, and your input matters! If you'd like to contribute, check out our contribution guidelines in the repository. Feedback, corrections, and new ideas are always welcome.
