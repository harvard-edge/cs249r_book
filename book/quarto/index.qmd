    <p>Machine Learning Systems provides a systematic framework for understanding and engineering machine learning (ML) systems. This textbook bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and practical engineering, emphasizing the systems perspective required to build effective AI solutions. Unlike resources that focus primarily on algorithms and model architectures, this book highlights the broader context in which ML systems operate, including data engineering, model optimization, hardware-aware training, and inference acceleration. Readers will develop the ability to reason about ML system architectures and apply enduring engineering principles for building flexible, efficient, and robust machine learning systems.</p>

## Why We Wrote This Book {.unnumbered}

**The Problem:** Students learn to train AI models, but few understand how to build the systems that actually make them work in production. When ML systems concepts are taught, students often learn individual components without grasping the holistic architecture—they can see the trees but miss the forest.

**The Future:** As AI becomes more autonomous, the bottleneck won't be just the algorithms—it will be the AI engineers who can build efficient, scalable, and sustainable systems.

**Our Approach:** This vision emerged from collaborative work in CS249r at Harvard University, where students, faculty, and industry partners came together to explore the systems side of ML. The content was developed through real student contributions during Fall 2023. What started as class notes has turned into a comprehensive educational resource we now share globally.
