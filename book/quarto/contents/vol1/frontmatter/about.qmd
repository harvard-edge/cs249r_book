# About This Volume {.unnumbered}

## Overview

Volume I: Introduction to ML Systems provides the foundational knowledge for understanding, building, optimizing, and deploying machine learning systems. This volume follows the Hennessy & Patterson pedagogical model, establishing the core concepts that all ML systems practitioners need.

## What This Volume Covers

**Part I: Foundations** asks: *What is ML systems engineering and how does development work?*

Before building neural networks, engineers must understand the unique characteristics of ML systems, how they differ from traditional software, and why they require specialized engineering approaches. This part develops the end to end workflow that guides ML projects from problem formulation to deployment.

**Part II: Build** asks: *How do we implement ML models from mathematical foundations to working systems?*

With workflow and data foundations established, students can appreciate why specific architectural choices matter. This part covers the mathematics of deep learning, examines major neural network architectures, explains how frameworks like PyTorch implement these ideas, and addresses the complexities of training models effectively.

**Part III: Optimize** asks: *How do we make ML systems efficient enough for real world deployment?*

Production constraints demand models that are smaller, faster, and more efficient than research prototypes. This part presents techniques for model compression and efficiency, surveys the hardware landscape from GPUs to specialized accelerators, and develops rigorous performance measurement methodologies.

**Part IV: Deploy** asks: *How do we operate ML systems reliably in production?*

Building an accurate model represents only part of the challenge. This part addresses infrastructure for serving predictions at scale, operational practices that keep systems running reliably, and engineering approaches for building systems that are fair, transparent, and trustworthy.

## Prerequisites

This volume assumes:

**Required:**
