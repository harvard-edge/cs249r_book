AI is bound to transform the world in profound ways, much like computers and the Internet revolutionized every aspect of society in the 20th century. From systems that generate creative content like text and images to those driving breakthroughs in drug discovery and scientific research, AI is ushering in a new era. But how do we make it accessible to everyone?

With its transformative power comes an equally great responsibility. Just as we expect companies to wield their influence ethically, those of us in academia bear a parallel responsibility: to share our knowledge openly, so it benefits everyone. This conviction inspired the creation of this book, an open source resource aimed at making AI education, particularly in AI engineering and systems, inclusive, and accessible to everyone from all walks of life.

**About This Volume**

Volume I: Introduction to ML Systems establishes the foundations you need to understand, build, optimize, and deploy machine learning systems. This volume is designed for students, practitioners, and researchers who want to develop a principled understanding of how ML systems work, from the mathematical foundations through to production deployment.

The content progresses through four parts:

- **Foundations** develops the mental models that underpin all effective ML systems work
- **Build** covers the complete development workflow from data engineering through training
- **Optimize** transforms theoretical understanding into efficient, resource-aware systems
- **Deploy** addresses serving, operations, and responsible engineering practices

By the end of this volume, you will have the conceptual foundation and practical skills to build complete ML systems on a single machine.

This book is a work in progress, but knowing that even one learner benefits from its content motivates me to continually refine and expand it.

This book is dedicated to the loving memory of my father. His passion for education, endless curiosity, generosity in sharing knowledge, and unwavering commitment to quality challenge me daily to strive for excellence in all I do.
