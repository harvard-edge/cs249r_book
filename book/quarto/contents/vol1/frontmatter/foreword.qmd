# Author's Note {.unnumbered}

::: {style="font-style: italic;"}

I wrote this book because I was lifted by books.

As a student, a handful of textbooks changed how I saw the world. Horowitz and Hill's *The Art of Electronics* showed me that deep understanding of hardware makes you a better designer at every level of abstraction. Hennessy and Patterson's *Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach* taught me that engineering is measurement, not intuition. Kennedy and Allen's *Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures* revealed how software and hardware are really one optimization problem. Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein's *Introduction to Algorithms* gave me the mathematical discipline to reason about complexity before writing a single line of code. Smith and Nair's *Virtual Machines* demonstrated that the right abstraction can reshape an entire field. These books did not just teach me subjects; they taught me how to think. Each one took a vast, messy landscape and revealed the principles underneath. Writing this book taught me the same lesson from the other side: I became a student of my own writing, forced to learn the field more deeply than research alone ever required.

That is what I have tried to do here. Machine learning systems are at the stage where the knowledge exists but the discipline does not. Practitioners are building extraordinary things, but there is no shared foundation---no common language of principles, no quantitative framework that lets an engineer reason about an ML system the way a computer architect reasons about a processor. This book is an attempt to provide that foundation. Not a survey of tools, not a collection of recipes, but the enduring building blocks that will still matter after the current frameworks and hardware have been replaced.

Those of us in academia have a responsibility to share what we know openly, so it benefits everyone. This conviction is why the book is open source. A discipline shaped by the open source community deserves a textbook accessible to everyone in it, regardless of geography or institutional affiliation. If even one student somewhere in the world builds something better because of what they learned here, the work was worth it.

This book is dedicated to the loving memory of my parents. My father's passion for education, endless curiosity, and unwavering commitment to quality challenge me daily to strive for excellence. My mother's instinct to share whatever she had, to care for those with less, taught me that knowledge, like everything else worth having, only matters if you give it away. Both legacies live in these pages.
