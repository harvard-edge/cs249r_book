This book owes its existence to a single conversation. During a sabbatical at Google, Pete Warden invited me to work on what seemed like an impossible moonshot: running keyword spotting on a microcontroller. That collaboration on TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers revealed something fundamental: the constraints that govern a 256 KB device are the same constraints that govern a data center GPU. Bandwidth, latency, energy, memory. The physics is the same; only the numbers change. That insight became the seed of this book.

The TinyML work led to an online course on HarvardX, co-taught with Laurence Moroney, that grew to over 100,000 students worldwide. Brian Plancher helped build the TinyML curriculum, and Shawn Hymel's careful notes improved the precision of the foundations material. Marcelo Rovai, a professor who first encountered the material through the TinyML course, went on to develop the hands-on labs and kits that accompany this book. Zach Shelby opened the Edge Impulse platform for student use. Massimo Banzi and the Arduino team, along with Eric Pan and Seeed Studio, collaborated with us in developing and providing the hardware kits that made hands-on instruction possible. Marco Zennaro brought the material to developing countries through ICTP and planted the idea that these principles deserved a proper textbook. Teaching at that scale, without one, made the need undeniable.

The book itself grew from CS249r at Harvard University. In 2023, the semester-long class project was to write the class notes: each student group took ownership of a topic, researched it, and worked with me to develop it into a chapter. That work seeded every chapter in this book. The premise was simple: writing forces you to think deeper than reading ever does. We opened it all on GitHub, and what began as rough class notes has been rewritten and refined with every semester since.

The book's intellectual foundations were shaped by collaborations that preceded the writing itself. My time at Google informed much of the systems thinking in these pages. The sabbatical began with performance modeling for the first Pixel SoC, drawing on my background in computer architecture. A collaboration with Mark Hill on roofline-style analytical modeling for heterogeneous SoCs taught me to reason about hardware from first principles, the kind of quantitative thinking that runs through every chapter of this book. That emphasis on analytical modeling led naturally to systematic evaluation, and systematic evaluation led to MLPerf. MLPerf involved many contributors across MLCommons, but I worked most closely with Peter Mattson, David Kanter, Carole-Jean Wu, Christine Cheng, Guenther Schmuelling, Cody Coleman, and Cliff Young. That collaboration shaped how I think about rigorous measurement of ML systems.

Boris Murmann and Song Han convinced me in the early stages that this project was worth pursuing. Throughout the writing, I sought feedback from colleagues in industry and academia alike. Practitioners at Arm, Google, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Qualcomm, STMicroelectronics, and other organizations offered perspectives grounded in production systems, while academic reviewers at universities across Europe, Asia, and the Americas stress-tested the material against their own research and teaching. Their combined feedback sharpened every chapter. Evgeni Gousev at Qualcomm and Pete Bernard at the Edge AI Foundation supported the project's outreach and helped build the community around it.

Beyond encouragement, instructors around the world put the material to the test in their own classrooms when it was still rough. Sophia Shao at UC Berkeley, Xiaofan (Fred) Jiang at Columbia, Tushar Krishna and Divya Mahajan at Georgia Tech, and Wenkai Guan at the University of Minnesota Morris were among the first, and instructors at IIT Bombay, NUST Pakistan, De La Salle University in the Philippines, and universities across Europe, Latin America, and Africa have since adopted the book for their own courses. Their willingness to teach from an unfinished textbook provided invaluable feedback and confirmed that the need for this material was not limited to any one institution or any one country.

My students in the Edge Computing Lab at Harvard contributed brainstorming, technical feedback, and sheer energy when the book was still taking shape: Andy Chang, Arya Tschand, Colby Banbury, Elisa Suitor, Ikechukwu Uchendu, Jason Jabbour, Jason Yik, Jeffrey Ma, Jessica Quaye, Mark Mazumder, Matthew Stewart, and Zishen Wan. Beyond the lab, Kai Kleinbard, then at the Harvard Extension School, built the online generative AI SocratiQ tutor bot. Naeem Khoshnevis established essential infrastructure including GitHub actions and documentation standards. Zeljko Hrcek produced the TikZ diagrams.

A textbook that distills principles from an active research field owes a debt to the researchers whose work it builds on. Beyond the named collaborators, an open source community shaped this book in ways that no single author could. Dozens of contributors caught errors, improved explanations, filed issues, and submitted pull requests. Some fixed a single typo; others rewrote entire sections. The book improved because people who owed it nothing chose to make it better. I am grateful to every one of them.

This work was supported by the Harvard Data Science Initiative, Harvard Extension School, and the National Science Foundation; by the Edge AI Foundation and ICTP for educational outreach and scholarships; and by Arduino, Edge Impulse, Google, and Seeed Studio for hardware, tooling, and infrastructure that made hands-on instruction possible.

At MIT Press, Susan Hartman believed in this project and guided it from an open source experiment to a published textbook. Her support, editorial judgment, and friendship made this book real in a way that GitHub alone could not. I am equally grateful to MIT Press for agreeing to keep this book available as open access. A textbook about a discipline shaped by the open source community should be accessible to everyone in it. That MIT Press shared this conviction made all the difference.

Finally, I thank my wife Kari and my daughters Nora and Maya. This book was written in the hours that belonged to them: late nights that started at ten and ended at two or three in the morning, weekends that disappeared into revisions, years of mornings when I was present but not quite there. What kept me going, beyond stubbornness, was the open source community. Every GitHub star was a signal that someone out there cared, that someone was learning, that the work mattered. The cost was real, and they paid it with patience I did not always deserve.
