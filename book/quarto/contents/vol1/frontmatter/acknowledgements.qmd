# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

This book is inspired by the [TinyML edX course](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/harvardx-tiny-machine-learning) and CS249r at Harvard University. It represents years of collaboration with students, researchers, and practitioners who have shaped its development.

Through this collaboration, our understanding of machine learning systems deepened, and we realized that fundamental principles apply across scales, from tiny embedded systems to large scale deployments. This realization shaped the book's expansion to provide foundations applicable across all scales of machine learning systems implementation.
