# Author's Note {.unnumbered}

::: {style="font-style: italic;"}

Andrew Ng famously said that AI is the new electricity. If so, then someone has to engineer the generators and build the grid---not just plug in the appliances. Who designs the training infrastructure? Who builds serving systems that scale? Who optimizes models to run on a phone or a sensor? Who architects the accelerators those models execute on? That work is AI engineering. And it is not yet recognized as a discipline.

We are building machine learning systems at a pace that outstrips our ability to build them well. By most industry estimates, the vast majority of AI projects never reach production or fail to deliver the value they promised. The failures are not exotic: a model degrades silently because no one built monitoring for distribution shift; a system that worked in the lab fails at the edge because latency requirements were never communicated to the team selecting architectures; a deployment pipeline breaks because the team retrained a model without versioning the data and cannot reproduce last week's results. These are not research problems. They are engineering problems, and they recur because the field lacks the shared principles, vocabulary, and training that a discipline provides.

Part of the gap is fragmentation. The knowledge to build ML systems exists, but it is scattered across silos. One course teaches compilers. Another covers hardware architecture. A third focuses on data pipelines. A fourth introduces the mathematics of optimization. Each is valuable on its own, but none of them teaches the *system*---the integrated machine where data, algorithms, frameworks, and hardware interact, constrain each other, and fail together. An ML system is not a model with infrastructure bolted on. It is a coupled engineering problem, and treating it as anything less produces systems that are fragile, inefficient, or both.

This book provides that missing integration. Not a survey of tools, not a collection of recipes, but the enduring principles that govern ML systems regardless of which framework or accelerator is fashionable this year. The best textbooks I encountered as a student did not teach me subjects; they taught me how to think. They took vast, messy landscapes and revealed the structure underneath. That is what I have tried to do here for AI engineering.

This book is dedicated to the loving memory of my parents. My father's passion for education and unwavering commitment to quality challenge me daily to strive for excellence. My mother taught me, by instinct more than instruction, that knowledge---like everything else worth having---only matters if you give it away.

# Welcome {.unnumbered}

  <div class="abstract-content">
    <p>Machine learning has evolved from a research discipline into an engineering practice. Building systems that learn from data requires more than understanding algorithms—it demands expertise spanning data pipelines, model development, optimization for deployment constraints, and operational practices. This book introduces AI engineering: the discipline of building ML systems that work in the real world. The treatment covers four areas: foundations (system characteristics, development workflows), building (deep learning mathematics, architectures, framework internals), optimization (compression, hardware acceleration, benchmarking), and deployment (serving infrastructure, operations, responsible engineering). The emphasis throughout is on engineering trade-offs and quantitative analysis.</p>

## What You Will Learn {.unnumbered}

Volume I progresses through four stages:

- **Part I: Foundations** — Build your conceptual foundation with mental models that underpin all effective systems work.
- **Part II: Build** — Engineer complete workflows from data pipelines through training infrastructure.
- **Part III: Optimize** — Transform theoretical understanding into systems that run efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
- **Part IV: Deploy** — Navigate serving, operations, and responsible engineering practices.

## Prerequisites {.unnumbered}

This book assumes:

- **Programming proficiency** in Python with familiarity in NumPy
- **Mathematics foundations** in linear algebra, calculus, and probability at the undergraduate level
- Prior ML experience is helpful but not required; @sec-deep-learning-systems-foundations provides essential background
