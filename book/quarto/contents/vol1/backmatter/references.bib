  location = {Singapore, Singapore},
  abstract = {
    Deep learning has rapidly transformed the state of the art algorithms used to address a variety
    of problems in computer vision and robotics. These breakthroughs have relied upon massive
    amounts of human annotated training data. This time consuming process has begun impeding the
    progress of these deep learning efforts. This paper describes a method to incorporate
    photo-realistic computer images from a simulation engine to rapidly generate annotated data
    that can be used for the training of machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate that a state
    of the art architecture, which is trained only using these synthetic annotations, performs
    better than the identical architecture trained on human annotated real-world data, when tested
    on the KITTI data set for vehicle detection. By training machine learning algorithms on a rich
    virtual world, real objects in real scenes can be learned and classified using synthetic data.
    This approach offers the possibility of accelerating deep learning's application to
    sensor-based classification problems like those that appear in self-driving cars. The source
    code and data to train and validate the networks described in this paper are made available for
    researchers.

    The seminal paper describing MOSFET scaling rules, predicting that as transistors shrink,
    voltage and current scale proportionally, keeping power density constant. This observation,
    known as Dennard scaling, enabled the free lunch era of processor frequency scaling until its
    breakdown around 2005.

    Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from
    domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC—called a Tensor Processing Unit
    (TPU) — deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural
    networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a
    peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip
    memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile
    response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of
    CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such
    features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively
    small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80
    GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the
    high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that
    represent 95

  abstract = {
    Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently widely used for many artificial intelligence (AI)
    applications including computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics. While DNNs deliver
    state-of-the-art accuracy on many AI tasks, it comes at the cost of high computational
    complexity. Accordingly, techniques that enable efficient processing of DNNs to improve energy
    efficiency and throughput without sacrificing application accuracy or increasing hardware cost
    are critical to the wide deployment of DNNs in AI systems. This article aims to provide a
    comprehensive tutorial and survey about the recent advances towards the goal of enabling
    efficient processing of DNNs. Specifically, it will provide an overview of DNNs, discuss
    various hardware platforms and architectures that support DNNs, and highlight key trends in
    reducing the computation cost of DNNs either solely via hardware design changes or via joint
    hardware design and DNN algorithm changes. It will also summarize various development resources
    that enable researchers and practitioners to quickly get started in this field, and highlight
    important benchmarking metrics and design considerations that should be used for evaluating the
    rapidly growing number of DNN hardware designs, optionally including algorithmic co-designs,
    being proposed in academia and industry. The reader will take away the following concepts from
    this article: understand the key design considerations for DNNs; be able to evaluate different
    DNN hardware implementations with benchmarks and comparison metrics; understand the trade-offs
    between various hardware architectures and platforms; be able to evaluate the utility of
    various DNN design techniques for efficient processing; and understand recent implementation
    trends and opportunities.

  address = {Online},
  editor = {Merlo, Paola and Tiedemann, Jorg and Tsarfaty, Reut},
  abstract = {
    The slow speed of BERT has motivated much research on accelerating its inference, and the early
    exiting idea has been proposed to make trade-offs between model quality and efficiency. This
    paper aims to address two weaknesses of previous work: (1) existing fine-tuning strategies for
    early exiting models fail to take full advantage of BERT; (2) methods to make exiting decisions
    are limited to classification tasks. We propose a more advanced fine-tuning strategy and a
    learning-to-exit module that extends early exiting to tasks other than classification.
    Experiments demonstrate improved early exiting for BERT, with better trade-offs obtained by the
    proposed fine-tuning strategy, successful application to regression tasks, and the possibility
    to combine it with other acceleration methods. Source code can be found at
    <https://github.com/castorini/berxit>.
