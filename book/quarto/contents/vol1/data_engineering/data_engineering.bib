    Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with
    complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide
    approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk
    score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of
    uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black
    patients receiving additional help from 17.7\% to 46.5\%. The bias arises because the algorithm
    predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend
    less money caring for Black patients than for White patients.
