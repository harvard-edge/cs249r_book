# Serving {#sec-serving}

::: {.callout-tip title="Learning Objectives"}

- Distinguish between training and inference workloads in terms of computational requirements, memory access patterns, and latency constraints
- Analyze the end-to-end latency breakdown of a single inference request from preprocessing through postprocessing
- Apply batching strategies to maximize throughput while meeting latency service level objectives
- Evaluate memory management techniques for efficient model loading and inference execution
- Design single-machine serving systems that balance throughput, latency, and resource utilization

## Purpose {.unnumbered}

This chapter addresses a fundamental question in machine learning systems: how do we transform a trained model into a responsive service that delivers predictions reliably and efficiently? While training focuses on learning from data over extended periods, serving demands consistent, low-latency responses for each individual request. This shift from batch processing to real-time response creates entirely different system requirements.

Understanding serving fundamentals is essential for every ML practitioner because even the most sophisticated model provides no value until it serves predictions to users. The techniques covered here, including inference optimization, batching strategies, and latency management, form the foundation for all deployment scenarios, from mobile applications to cloud services. Mastering single-machine serving prepares you for the scaling challenges addressed in Volume II while providing immediately applicable skills for deploying models in production environments.
