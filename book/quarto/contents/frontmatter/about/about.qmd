While maintaining its academic rigor and real-world applicability, it continues to evolve through regular updates and careful curation to reflect the latest developments in machine learning systems.

### What to Expect {#sec-book-expect-df55}

This textbook follows a carefully designed pedagogical progression that mirrors how expert ML systems engineers develop their skills. The learning journey unfolds in five distinct phases:

**Phase 1: Theory** - Build your conceptual foundation through **Foundations** and **Design Principles**, establishing the mental models that underpin all effective systems work.

**Phase 2: Performance** - Master **Performance Engineering** to transform theoretical understanding into systems that run efficiently in resource-constrained real-world environments.

**Phase 3: Practice** - Navigate **Robust Deployment** challenges, learning how to make systems work reliably beyond the controlled environment of development.

**Phase 4: Ethics** - Explore **Trustworthy Systems** to ensure your systems serve society beneficially and sustainably.

**Phase 5: Vision** - Look toward **ML Systems Frontiers** to understand emerging paradigms and prepare for the next generation of challenges.

**Laboratory exercises** are strategically positioned after the core theoretical foundation, allowing you to apply concepts with hands-on experience across multiple embedded platforms. Throughout the book, **quizzes** provide quick self-checks to reinforce understanding at key learning milestones.

### Prerequisites {#sec-book-prerequisites-4a7c}

This textbook assumes the following background:

**Required**:

- **Programming Proficiency**: Fluency in Python is essential, as all code examples and laboratory exercises use Python. Familiarity with NumPy for numerical computing and basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts are expected.

- **Mathematics Foundations**: Understanding of linear algebra (vectors, matrices, matrix operations), calculus (derivatives, gradients, chain rule), and probability (distributions, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem) at the undergraduate level. These concepts appear throughout discussions of model training, optimization, and inference.

**Recommended but Not Required**:

- **Computer Systems**: Familiarity with memory hierarchies, CPU/GPU architecture basics, and operating systems concepts will enhance understanding of hardware acceleration and deployment chapters. Students without this background can still succeed but may need to reference supplementary materials.

- **Machine Learning Basics**: Prior exposure to supervised learning concepts (classification, regression), neural network fundamentals, and common architectures (CNNs, RNNs) is helpful but not strictly required. The Deep Learning Primer chapter provides essential background for those new to these topics.

### Pedagogical Philosophy: Foundations First {#sec-book-pedagogical-philosophy-foundations-first-4f88-foundations-first-4f88}

Machine learning systems represent inherently complex engineering challenges. However, they are constructed from fundamental building blocks that must be thoroughly understood before advancing to sophisticated implementations. This pedagogical approach parallels established educational progressions: students master basic algorithms before tackling distributed systems, or develop proficiency in linear algebra before engaging with advanced machine learning theory. ML systems similarly possess essential foundational components that serve as the basis for all subsequent learning.

Our curriculum emphasizes mastery of these core building blocks:

- The interaction between models and hardware
- Data flow patterns through systems
- Computational pattern emergence
- Optimization principles within individual systems

Through comprehensive understanding of these fundamentals, students develop the analytical framework necessary to reason effectively about complex scenarios including distributed training architectures, multi-device coordination protocols, and emerging technological paradigms.

This foundations-first methodology prioritizes conceptual depth over topical breadth. This approach enables students to construct robust mental models that will serve as enduring intellectual resources throughout their professional careers as machine learning systems continue to evolve.

### For Students with Different Backgrounds {#sec-book-students-different-backgrounds-21ef}

This textbook welcomes students from diverse academic backgrounds, whether you come from computer science, engineering, mathematics, or other fields. Understanding how ML systems connect to your existing knowledge helps bridge theoretical concepts to practical implementation:

**Computer Science Students**: ML systems extend familiar concepts into new domains. If you've worked with algorithms and data structures, think of ML as learning algorithms that automatically optimize themselves based on data patterns rather than following fixed instructions.

Your experience with system design, memory management, parallel processing, and distributed systems directly applies to ML deployment. The underlying computational complexity analysis still applies—we analyze time and space complexity for training and inference phases separately.

**Electrical and Computer Engineering Students**: ML systems represent a natural evolution of signal processing and control systems principles. Machine learning can be viewed as advanced signal processing where we extract meaningful patterns from noisy, high-dimensional signals.

Neural networks perform operations similar to filters—convolution layers in image processing are literally convolution operations you've studied. Your background in computer systems organization and architecture becomes essential for understanding how ML algorithms map to different hardware platforms, while your understanding of memory hierarchies helps optimize data movement in large-scale training systems.

**Students from Other Backgrounds**: Think of ML systems like a modern factory assembly line. Just as a factory transforms raw materials into finished products through coordinated stages, ML systems transform raw data into useful predictions through interconnected components.

The mathematics—linear algebra, probability, and calculus—are the "tools" of this factory, but you don't need to be a tool expert to understand how the assembly line works. Most concepts become clear through concrete examples, like understanding how a recommendation system works by thinking about how a librarian might suggest books based on your reading history.

The key skill is systems thinking: understanding how data pipelines, training processes, and deployment infrastructure work together, much like how supply chains, manufacturing, and distribution must coordinate in any complex operation.

### Modular Design {#sec-book-modular-design-8b30}

The book is designed for flexible learning, allowing readers to explore chapters independently or follow suggested sequences. Each chapter integrates:

- **Interactive quizzes** for self-assessment and knowledge reinforcement
- **Practical exercises** connecting theory to implementation
- **Laboratory experiences** providing hands-on platform-specific learning

We embrace an iterative approach to content development—sharing valuable insights as they become available rather than waiting for perfection. Your feedback helps us continuously improve and refine this resource.

We also build upon the excellent work of experts in the field, fostering a collaborative learning ecosystem where knowledge is shared, extended, and collectively advanced.

## Transparency and Collaboration {#sec-book-transparency-collaboration-171f}

This book began as a community-driven project shaped by the collective efforts of students in CS249r, colleagues at Harvard and beyond, and the broader ML systems community. Its content has evolved through open collaboration, thoughtful feedback, and modern editing tools—including both rule-based scripts and generative AI technologies. In a fitting twist, the very systems we study in this book have helped refine its pages, highlighting the interplay between human expertise and machine intelligence. Fortunately, they're not quite ready to engineer the systems themselves—at least, not yet.

As the primary author, editor, and curator, I (Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi) provide human-in-the-loop oversight to ensure the textbook material remains accurate, relevant, and of the highest quality. Still, no one is perfect—so errors may exist. Your feedback is welcome and encouraged. This collaborative model is essential for maintaining quality and ensuring that knowledge remains open, evolving, and globally accessible.
