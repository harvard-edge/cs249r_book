# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Machine Learning Systems, your gateway to the fast-paced world of machine learning (ML) systems. This book is an extension of the [CS249r](https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/cs249-tinyml-2023) course at Harvard University, expanding from TinyML to broader ML systems topics, taught by Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi, and is the result of a collaborative effort involving students, professionals, and the broader community of AI practitioners.

We've created this open-source book for students and practitioners to demystify the process of building efficient and scalable ML systems. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive guide that covers the principles, practices, and challenges of developing robust ML pipelines for deployment. This isn't a static textbook—it's a living, evolving resource designed to keep pace with advancements in the field.

This book connects foundational principles with practical workflows from a systems engineering perspective. You'll learn about data collection, model design, optimization, acceleration, and security hardening, all focused on real-world deployment challenges.

After reading this book, you'll be able to design ML training pipelines, optimize models for deployment, and debug production ML systems. Whether you're a computer science student learning ML systems, an engineer deploying AI in production, or a researcher building novel architectures, this community-driven resource will guide your journey.

## Why We Wrote This Book {#sec-preface-wrote-book-9fb6}

In a world where technology is constantly evolving, open collaboration and shared knowledge are essential for innovation. Unlike traditional textbooks that become outdated quickly, this book serves as a living knowledge hub that evolves with the field, inviting contributions and fostering a global community of learners and innovators.

By focusing on the principles and practices of ML systems engineering, we aim to help you build the skills needed to deploy and maintain AI solutions at scale. Together, let's explore the potential of machine learning to transform industries and improve lives.
