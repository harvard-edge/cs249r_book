    The slow speed of BERT has motivated much research on accelerating its inference, and the early
    exiting idea has been proposed to make trade-offs between model quality and efficiency. This
    paper aims to address two weaknesses of previous work: (1) existing fine-tuning strategies for
    early exiting models fail to take full advantage of BERT; (2) methods to make exiting decisions
    are limited to classification tasks. We propose a more advanced fine-tuning strategy and a
    learning-to-exit module that extends early exiting to tasks other than classification.
    Experiments demonstrate improved early exiting for BERT, with better trade-offs obtained by the
    proposed fine-tuning strategy, successful application to regression tasks, and the possibility
    to combine it with other acceleration methods. Source code can be found at
    <https://github.com/castorini/berxit>.
