            "answer": "ML systems require monitoring of infrastructure health, model performance, data quality, and prediction distributions, whereas traditional software monitoring focuses primarily on infrastructure metrics like uptime and latency. This is necessary because ML systems can degrade due to data distribution shifts, model drift, or environmental changes without any code changes or infrastructure failures. For example, a recommendation system's accuracy might decline as user preferences evolve, requiring monitoring beyond traditional infrastructure metrics. This comprehensive monitoring enables early detection of performance degradation before it impacts users.",
