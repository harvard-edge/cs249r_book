# Responsible Systems

::: {.callout-note title="Chapter Status"}
This chapter is under development. It will provide a brief introduction to responsible AI systems concepts that are covered in depth in Volume II.
:::

## Overview

As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into critical applications, understanding the foundations of responsible deployment becomes essential. This chapter provides a preview of key concepts that every ML practitioner should be aware of, with deeper treatment available in Volume II.

## Topics Covered

This preview chapter introduces:

- **Robustness**: Understanding how models can fail and the importance of robust design
- **Security**: Basic awareness of adversarial attacks and model vulnerabilities
- **Fairness**: Introduction to bias in ML systems and fairness considerations
- **Sustainability**: Environmental impact of training and inference

Each topic is explored in depth in Volume II's dedicated chapters on Robust AI, Privacy-Preserving ML, Responsible AI Systems, and Sustainable AI.

## Coming Soon

Detailed content for this chapter is being developed. Check back for updates or see Volume II for comprehensive coverage of these critical topics.
