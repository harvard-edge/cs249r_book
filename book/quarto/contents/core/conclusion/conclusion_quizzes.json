Additionally, evaluating these models is difficult because traditional metrics for classification tasks may not apply. For example, assessing the quality of generated images or text involves subjective criteria. This is important because it affects how these models are deployed and integrated into real-world applications.",

            "answer": "Focusing on data quality and diversity helps ensure that models are trained on representative datasets that reflect real-world complexities. This reduces the risk of biased outcomes by promoting fairness and generalizability across different populations and contexts. For example, using diverse datasets can prevent models from making inaccurate predictions based on skewed data distributions. This is important because it enhances the model's applicability and ethical use in various scenarios.",
