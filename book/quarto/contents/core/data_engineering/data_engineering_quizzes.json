            "answer": "The correct answer is B. Prioritizing data quality over acquisition cost. This is correct because data engineering often involves balancing the quality of data with the costs associated with acquiring it. Other options do not represent trade-offs but rather one-sided focuses.",

            "answer": "The four pillars form an interconnected framework where optimizing one often impacts the others. For example, improving data quality might increase acquisition costs, affecting scalability. Similarly, enhancing governance can improve reliability but may limit scalability due to compliance constraints. This interconnectedness requires a balanced approach to ensure system robustness and efficiency.",

            "answer": "When implementing a storage architecture, one must balance performance requirements with economic constraints. For instance, high-speed storage improves training iteration speed and serving latency but increases costs. Conversely, more economical storage options may slow down these processes. A tiered storage strategy can help balance these trade-offs by allocating resources based on access frequency and performance needs.",
