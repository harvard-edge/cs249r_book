# Fault Tolerance and Reliability {#sec-fault-tolerance}

## Purpose {.unnumbered}

_Why must machine learning systems continue delivering predictions reliably despite inevitable hardware failures, network outages, and unexpected operational disruptions?_

Machine learning systems deployed in production environments operate in a world of uncertainty: infrastructure fails, networks disconnect, data becomes corrupted, and computational resources become unavailable without warning. Unlike experimental systems that can simply restart when encountering failures, production ML systems serve millions of users and support critical decision-making, where reliability determines whether organizations can trust these systems with consequential outcomes. Yet unlike traditional software systems where failures manifest visibly through errors and exceptions, ML system degradation under fault conditions often remains silent and undetected until catastrophic loss of service occurs. The economic and social costs of unreliability are substantial: recommendation systems silently serving degraded predictions erode user trust; healthcare diagnostic systems becoming unavailable jeopardize patient care; autonomous systems losing fault tolerance become dangerous. Mastering fault tolerance transforms ML systems from fragile prototypes dependent on perfect conditions into resilient systems capable of sustained operation in production environments.

## Coming 2026

This chapter will cover checkpointing, recovery, and graceful degradation in ML systems.
