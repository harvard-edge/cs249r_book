# Principles of Production {.unnumbered}

These principles define the security and reliability requirements for production-grade systems. They ensure the fleet is robust against attacks and misuse.

**The Law**: Every model output potentially leaks information about its training data. Perfect privacy is mathematically impossible if the model is useful (The Fundamental Law of Information Recovery).
$$ I(TrainingData; ModelOutput) > 0 $$

**The Engineering Implication**:
Privacy is a budget, not a switch. You cannot "anonymize" data once it is memorized by weights. Systems requiring strict privacy must implement **Differential Privacy** (DP) to quantify and cap the information leakage (\(\epsilon\)) per query, halting access when the budget is exhausted.

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="The Robustness Compute Penalty"}
**The Law**: Achieving intrinsic adversarial robustness requires training on perturbations, which demands ~8–10$\times$ more compute per epoch than standard optimization.

**The Engineering Implication**:
There is no "free" robustness. Building secure models is computationally expensive. For many applications, it is more efficient to rely on **external guardrails** (input filtering, output verification) than to train intrinsic robustness into the model weights.

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="The Jevons Paradox of AI (The Efficiency Trap)"}
**The Law**: Improvements in efficiency that lower the cost of a resource will tend to increase, rather than decrease, the total consumption of that resource.
$$ \text{Efficiency} \uparrow \implies \text{Cost} \downarrow \implies \text{Demand} \uparrow \uparrow $$

**The Engineering Implication**:
Making models 10x more efficient will likely lead to 100x more usage, not 10x energy savings (Induced Demand). Sustainability strategies must focus on **absolute limits** (carbon budgets, renewable sourcing) rather than just rate efficiency (FLOPS/watt).
