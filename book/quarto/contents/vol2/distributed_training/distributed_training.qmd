# Distributed Training Systems {#sec-distributed-training}

## Purpose {.unnumbered}

_What makes distributed training not merely a technical optimization, but a fundamental shift in how we approach machine learning at scale?_

Distributed training transforms from an engineering convenience into an architectural necessity when training demands exceed the capabilities of individual machines, yet the principles governing coordination across distributed systems fundamentally reshape how we think about optimization, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency. Moving from single-machine to distributed training requires understanding not just how to parallelize computation, but how communication overhead, synchronization costs, and system heterogeneity create entirely new constraints that affect algorithm design and system architecture. The challenges of distributed training including parameter synchronization across thousands of devices, absorbing failures without losing progress, and balancing communication with computation demand different engineering solutions than single-device scenarios. As models grow to billions of parameters and training datasets expand to continental scales, distributed training becomes the foundation upon which feasible machine learning systems are built, directly determining which problems can be tackled, which timelines are realistic, and which organizations can meaningfully participate in advanced AI development.

## Coming 2026

This chapter will build on Volume I's distributed basics to cover large-scale training systems.
