Volume II: Advanced Machine Learning Systems takes on the problem that most foundational texts leave unfinished: what happens when a machine learning system must span more than one machine. This book teaches you to build and operate ML systems across distributed infrastructure.

The transition from single machine to distributed systems represents one of the most significant challenges in ML engineering. Models that train in hours on a single GPU may require weeks without proper parallelization strategies. Inference systems that work perfectly in development may fail catastrophically under production load. This book treats each of these challenges with the same quantitative rigor applied to single-machine systems.

**What This Book Covers**

We begin with **Foundations of Scale**, the physical infrastructure, storage systems, and communication patterns that make distributed ML possible. From there, **Distributed Training** develops the parallelism and fault tolerance strategies that training at production scale demands. We then turn to **Production Concerns**, the real-world complexity of edge deployment, security, privacy, and robust system design. The volume closes with **Responsible AI at Scale**, which examines sustainable computing, beneficial applications, and the emerging system architectures on the horizon.

**Prerequisites**

This book assumes familiarity with foundational concepts including ML workflows, neural network architectures, optimization techniques, and deployment fundamentals. Readers new to ML systems should establish this background first.

**A Collaborative Effort**

This book has been shaped by contributions from students, researchers, and practitioners worldwide. The distributed systems and production challenges covered here reflect hard-won lessons from deploying ML at scale. I am grateful to everyone who has shared their expertise to make this knowledge accessible.

Building AI systems at scale is an act of engineering judgment: every architectural decision carries consequences for performance, cost, fairness, and environmental impact. I hope this book gives you the quantitative tools and ethical grounding to make those decisions well.
