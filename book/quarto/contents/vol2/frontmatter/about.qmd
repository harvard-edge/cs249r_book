# About This Volume {.unnumbered}

## Overview

Volume II: Advanced ML Systems extends the foundations from Volume I to address distributed systems, production deployment at scale, and responsible AI practices. This volume follows the Hennessy & Patterson pedagogical model, building upon single machine concepts to tackle the challenges of ML systems that span multiple machines and serve millions of users.

## What This Volume Covers

**Part V: Foundations of Scale** asks: *What infrastructure enables ML systems to operate across multiple machines?*

Scaling beyond a single machine requires understanding physical infrastructure, storage systems, and the communication patterns that coordinate distributed computation. This part establishes the foundational context for distributed ML systems.

**Part VI: Distributed Systems** asks: *How do we train models too large for any single machine and serve them at scale?*

Modern models often exceed the memory and compute capacity of individual GPUs. This part develops parallelism strategies, communication techniques, fault tolerance mechanisms, and inference optimization approaches that enable ML at unprecedented scale.

**Part VII: Production Concerns** asks: *How do we navigate real world complexity in production ML systems?*

From edge intelligence to security threats and adversarial inputs, production systems face multifaceted challenges. This part addresses on device learning, robust system design, security, and privacy requirements.

**Part VIII: Responsible AI at Scale** asks: *How do we ensure ML systems are sustainable and benefit society?*

Technical excellence alone is insufficient. This part addresses responsible AI practices, environmental sustainability, beneficial applications, and the emerging frontiers that will shape the future of ML systems.
