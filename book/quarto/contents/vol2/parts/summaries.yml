  - key: "volume_2"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "division"
    numbered: false
    title: "Volume II: Machine Learning Systems at Scale"
    description: >
      Volume II explores advanced topics for distributed and production-scale systems,
      focusing on the infrastructure and coordination required to scale beyond single machines.

  - key: "vol2_fleet"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "part"
    numbered: true
    title: "The Fleet"
    description: >
      This part builds the physical substrate of the Machine Learning Fleet. It covers
      the introduction to distributed ML systems, compute infrastructure design, network
      fabrics that connect the fleet, and the scalable data systems that feed training pipelines.

  - key: "vol2_distributed"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "part"
    numbered: true
    title: "Distributed ML"
    description: >
      This part establishes the logic of distribution: how to partition workloads across
      thousands of devices. It covers parallelism strategies, collective communication
      primitives, fault tolerance mechanisms, and fleet orchestration.

  - key: "vol2_deployment"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "part"
    numbered: true
    title: "Deployment at Scale"
    description: >
      This part takes the trained model from the cluster to the world. It covers
      inference serving at massive scale, performance engineering for efficiency,
      edge intelligence for resource-constrained devices, and platform operations.

  - key: "vol2_responsible"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "part"
    numbered: true
    title: "The Responsible Fleet"
    description: >
      This part confronts the forces that determine whether the fleet serves its users
      or harms them. It addresses security and privacy, robustness, sustainability,
      and responsible engineering as fundamental system constraints.
