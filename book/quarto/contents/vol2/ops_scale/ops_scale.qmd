# ML Operations at Scale {#sec-ops-scale}

::: {layout-narrow}
::: {.column-margin}
_DALL·E 3 Prompt: A comprehensive visualization of enterprise ML operations orchestrating hundreds of models across distributed infrastructure. The scene shows a unified platform architecture with multiple model pipelines flowing through shared infrastructure. Visual elements include a central control plane dashboard displaying health metrics for dozens of deployed models, CI/CD pipelines depicted as automated assembly lines moving models from development through staging to production, and infrastructure-as-code templates generating consistent environments. Teams of engineers interact with self-service interfaces while governance policies appear as guardrails along deployment paths. Monitoring systems display aggregate metrics, A/B test results, and model performance trends. The composition emphasizes scale with many models in simultaneous operation connected to shared data sources and compute resources. Color scheme uses professional blues and grays for infrastructure with accent colors distinguishing different model types and team ownership. Modern enterprise software visualization style suitable for an MLOps engineering textbook._

## Purpose {.unnumbered}

_Why do the operational practices that suffice for individual ML projects fail catastrophically when organizations deploy hundreds of models across distributed infrastructure?_

Operating machine learning systems at organizational scale introduces challenges fundamentally different from managing individual models: teams must coordinate across dozens of models with interdependent data pipelines, version artifacts across complex experimental workflows, and maintain reliability for systems where gradual degradation affects millions of users. The practices that enable a single team to iterate on one model become unsustainable when multiplied across an enterprise, requiring platform abstractions that provide self-service capabilities while maintaining governance and consistency. Organizations discover that operational excellence at scale demands new organizational structures, communication patterns, and engineering cultures alongside improved tooling. Understanding how platform engineering, multi-model management, and infrastructure-as-code practices address these challenges enables engineers to build ML operations that scale with organizational growth rather than becoming bottlenecks that constrain what teams can accomplish.

## Coming 2026

This chapter will cover platform engineering, multi-model management, ML infrastructure as code, organizational patterns, and production debugging at scale.
