# ML Operations at Scale {#sec-ops-scale}

## Purpose {.unnumbered}

_Why do the operational practices that suffice for individual ML projects fail catastrophically when organizations deploy hundreds of models across distributed infrastructure?_

Operating machine learning systems at organizational scale introduces challenges qualitatively different from managing individual models: teams must coordinate across dozens of models with interdependent data pipelines, version artifacts across complex experimental workflows, and maintain reliability for systems where silent degradation affects millions of users. The practices that enable a single team to iterate on one model become unsustainable when multiplied across an enterprise, requiring platform abstractions that provide self-service capabilities while maintaining governance and consistency. Organizations discover that operational excellence at scale demands not just better tools but different organizational structures, communication patterns, and engineering cultures. Understanding how platform engineering, multi-model management, and infrastructure-as-code practices address these challenges enables engineers to build ML operations that scale with organizational growth rather than becoming bottlenecks that constrain what teams can accomplish.

## Coming 2026

This chapter will cover platform engineering, multi-model management, ML infrastructure as code, organizational patterns, and production debugging at scale.
