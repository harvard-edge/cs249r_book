# Edge Intelligence Systems {#sec-edge-intelligence}

## Purpose {.unnumbered}

_How do we reconcile the computational capabilities of centralized AI systems with the latency, privacy, and operational constraints that demand intelligence distributed across heterogeneous edge devices?_

Machine learning systems increasingly operate in environments where centralizing computation to cloud infrastructure becomes infeasible: connected vehicles processing sensor streams at highway speeds cannot tolerate network round-trip latencies; medical devices analyzing patient data cannot transmit sensitive information externally; autonomous robots operating in communication-constrained environments require local decision-making capability. Yet edge devices operate under severe computational, power, and memory constraints that fundamentally transform the engineering challenges compared to datacenter-scale systems. Edge intelligence represents a shift from building monolithic models optimized for single environments to architecting ecosystems where billions of heterogeneous devices coordinate with cloud infrastructure while maintaining autonomy, privacy, and resilience. Understanding these systems is essential for engineers building the distributed intelligence infrastructure that enables autonomous systems, IoT platforms, and applications operating at the boundary between digital and physical worlds.

## Coming 2026

This chapter will cover edge deployment, fleet management, and edge-cloud coordination.
