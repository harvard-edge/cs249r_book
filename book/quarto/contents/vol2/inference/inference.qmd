# Inference at Scale {#sec-inference}

## Purpose {.unnumbered}

_Why does serving machine learning predictions at scale require fundamentally different engineering approaches than training the models that generate them?_

Training optimizes for throughput over extended periods, tolerating latency variations that would be unacceptable when users await responses in real time. Inference at scale inverts these priorities: serving systems must deliver predictions within strict latency bounds while handling request volumes that fluctuate unpredictably across hours, days, and seasons. The engineering challenges of inference extend beyond raw performance to encompass resource efficiency when serving costs dwarf training costs over a model's lifetime, availability when users expect continuous service regardless of infrastructure conditions, and consistency when the same input must produce the same output across globally distributed serving infrastructure. Understanding how serving systems, batching strategies, model sharding, and load balancing address these challenges determines whether sophisticated models deliver value to users or remain impressive but impractical demonstrations. Mastering inference at scale transforms model capabilities into reliable services that operate continuously at the speed and scale users demand.

## Coming 2026

This chapter will cover serving systems, batching, model sharding, and load balancing.
