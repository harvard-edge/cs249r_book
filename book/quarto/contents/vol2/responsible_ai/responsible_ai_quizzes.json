For instance, enhancing privacy by minimizing data collection may limit the ability to improve fairness through model updates. Similarly, optimizing for efficiency might compromise fairness if resource constraints lead to less robust models. These challenges require stakeholder engagement and value-sensitive design to ensure that systems align with diverse ethical and operational priorities. For example, a mental health chatbot must balance patient privacy with the need for effective crisis intervention, highlighting the complexity of such trade-offs.",
