# Welcome to Volume II {.unnumbered}

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
```{=html}
<div class="abstract-section">
  <div class="abstract-content">
    <p>Modern machine learning operates at scales that fundamentally change engineering requirements—models too large for single GPUs, services spanning continents, deployments carrying societal responsibilities. This book addresses AI engineering at scale. The treatment follows the lifecycle of a massive-scale system: defining the distributed architecture, building the physical infrastructure fleet, ensuring operational reliability, deploying to global users, and hardening the system for safety and responsibility.</p>

## What You Will Learn {.unnumbered}

Volume II extends the foundations into production-scale systems through five parts:

- **Part I: Foundations of Distributed Training** — Master the algorithms of scale. Learn how to split massive models across thousands of devices using Data, Tensor, and Pipeline parallelism, and understand the collective communication primitives that coordinate them.
- **Part II: The Machine Learning Fleet** — Build the physical supercomputer. Architect the accelerators, power, cooling, and storage systems required to support distributed workloads, and engineer the fault tolerance mechanisms to keep them running.
- **Part III: Deployment & Operations at Scale** — Serve the world. Navigate the shift from training throughput to inference latency, push intelligence to the edge, and manage the MLOps lifecycle of production fleets.
- **Part IV: Trustworthy Systems** — Harden the system. Tackle the production concerns of robust AI, privacy, security, and sustainability to ensure systems are safe and efficient.
- **Part V: Frontiers** — Shape the future. Explore responsible AI governance, AI for social good, and the emerging architecture of AGI systems.

## Prerequisites {.unnumbered}

This volume assumes:

- **Volume I or equivalent** background in single-machine ML systems
- **Programming proficiency** in Python with familiarity in NumPy
- **Mathematics foundations** in linear algebra, calculus, and probability
- Familiarity with distributed systems concepts (networking, parallelism) is helpful for advanced topics
