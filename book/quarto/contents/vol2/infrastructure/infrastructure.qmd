_DALL·E 3 Prompt: A sweeping architectural visualization of a modern AI datacenter infrastructure. The scene reveals a massive facility with rows of GPU clusters arranged in pods, connected by high-bandwidth networking fabric depicted as glowing fiber optic pathways. Cooling systems appear as flowing blue currents between server racks. The visualization includes multiple layers: physical infrastructure at the bottom with power and cooling, compute infrastructure in the middle with thousands of interconnected accelerators, and orchestration software at the top represented as an abstract control plane. Visual elements include resource managers allocating workloads, capacity graphs showing utilization, and geographic connections to other datacenters. The color scheme uses industrial grays and silvers with accent colors of electric blue for networking and amber for active computation. Photorealistic technical illustration style suitable for infrastructure engineering documentation._

## Purpose {.unnumbered}

_Why does the ability to build and manage computational infrastructure determine which organizations can realize their most ambitious machine learning goals?_

Machine learning systems that transform industries operate on infrastructure far exceeding the scale of single machines or small clusters. Training a frontier model may require thousands of GPUs coordinated across multiple datacenters, each machine contributing to a unified computation that can span weeks or months. Managing such infrastructure demands expertise in datacenter design, high-bandwidth networking, and distributed systems orchestration. The infrastructure must satisfy competing requirements: computational efficiency alongside fault tolerance, coordination across thousands of machines without prohibitive communication overhead, and dynamic capacity provisioning that controls costs. These challenges have become central to machine learning advancement, as organizations cannot access frontier capabilities without mastering the physical and software systems that make large-scale computation possible. Understanding infrastructure architecture is essential for building systems beyond prototype experiments, shaping whether organizations deploy efficiently, scale reliably, and compete effectively in an increasingly infrastructure-dependent landscape.

## Coming 2026

This chapter will cover datacenter architecture, cluster design, and resource management for ML workloads.
