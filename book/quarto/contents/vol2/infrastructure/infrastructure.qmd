# Large-Scale ML Infrastructure {#sec-infrastructure}

## Purpose {.unnumbered}

_Why does the ability to build and manage computational infrastructure determine which organizations can realize their most ambitious machine learning goals?_

Machine learning systems that transform industries operate on infrastructure vastly more complex than single machines or small clusters, requiring coordinated management of datacenters, network systems, and distributed computing resources at massive scale. The infrastructure underlying production ML systems must satisfy contradictory demands: maximizing computational efficiency while maintaining fault tolerance, coordinating thousands of machines while minimizing communication overhead, and provisioning capacity that responds dynamically to shifting demand while controlling costs. These infrastructure challenges have become fundamental to machine learning advancement, as organizations cannot access frontier computational capabilities without deep expertise in datacenter design, cluster orchestration, and resource management. Understanding infrastructure architecture is essential for anyone building systems that extend beyond prototype experiments, determining whether organizations deploy capabilities efficiently, scale reliably to serve real demand, and compete effectively in an increasingly infrastructure-dependent landscape.

## Coming 2026

This chapter will cover datacenter architecture, cluster design, and resource management for ML workloads.
