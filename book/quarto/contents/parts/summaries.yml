    title: "Frontmatter"
    description: >
      This part welcomes readers to the textbook and provides the introductory material
      that frames the journey ahead. It includes the foreword, acknowledgments, and
      sections about the book's purpose and structure, helping readers understand how
      to navigate the material and engage with the broader learning experience.

    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "division"
    numbered: false
    title: "Main"
    description: >
      This division contains the core material of the textbook, organized into
      foundational concepts, design principles, and advanced topics in machine
      learning systems engineering.

  - key: "foundations"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "part"
    numbered: true
    title: "Systems Foundations"
    description: >
      This part introduces the conceptual and algorithmic foundations of machine learning
      systems. It traces the evolution of machine learning and deep learning, showing how
      models and algorithms define the computational substrate on which modern systems
      operate. These chapters prepare readers to understand the relationship between
      algorithmic design and the system-level considerations explored later in the book.

  - key: "principles"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "part"
    numbered: true
    title: "Design Principles"
    description: >
      This part examines the structural composition of machine learning systems. It
      explores the key components—data pipelines, training processes, and execution
      frameworks—that interact to create complete systems. Readers will develop an
      understanding of how the "nuts and bolts" of a machine learning system fit
      together, forming the foundation for later discussions on efficiency and
      deployment.

  - key: "performance"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "part"
    numbered: true
    title: "Performance Engineering"
    description: >
      This part focuses on improving the performance and efficiency of machine learning
      systems. It explores strategies for accelerating computation, reducing resource
      consumption, and achieving cost-effective scaling. These chapters demonstrate how
      architectural understanding translates into practical techniques for building
      systems that run faster, leaner, and more effectively in real-world environments.

  - key: "deployment"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "part"
    numbered: true
    title: "Robust Deployment"
    description: >
      This part addresses the transition of machine learning systems from development
      to real-world operation, following a natural progression from individual devices
      to distributed systems. Starting with on-device learning constraints, advancing
      through security and privacy as systems scale, examining robustness against
      failures, and culminating in ML operations that orchestrate these elements into
      comprehensive production deployment frameworks.

  - key: "responsibility"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "part"
    numbered: true
    title: "Trustworthy Systems"
    description: >
      This part focuses on building machine learning systems that earn and maintain
      trust through reliable, secure, ethical, and sustainable operation. It explores
      the technical mechanisms, design patterns, and engineering practices that ensure
      systems operate safely and beneficially in real-world environments. Readers will
      understand how to engineer trustworthiness as a fundamental system property
      rather than an afterthought.

  - key: "futures"
    division: "mainmatter"
    type: "part"
    numbered: true
    title: "Frontiers"
    description: >
      This part looks ahead to the emerging frontiers of machine learning systems.
      It explores new computational paradigms, early-stage innovations, and the
      rapidly evolving landscape of ML applications. The concluding chapter reflects
      on the building blocks presented throughout the textbook and prepares readers
      to engage with the next generation of machine learning systems.
