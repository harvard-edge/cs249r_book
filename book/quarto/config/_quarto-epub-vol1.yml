  abstract: |
    Machine learning systems engineering is a discipline governed by physical law. Memory bandwidth, arithmetic intensity, power envelopes, and the speed of data movement — not engineering convention — determine which architectures succeed and which fail. The full lifecycle of an ML system — from data ingestion through production deployment — becomes comprehensible through a single machine: by limiting scope to what one node provides and withholds, the constraints that govern every design decision become visible.

    Four parts develop this understanding progressively. Part I establishes foundations: the landscape of ML deployment paradigms and their physical constraints, the end-to-end ML workflow as a systems discipline, and data engineering as infrastructure with its own quality, reliability, and governance demands. Part II examines how models are built: the computational machinery of neural networks, the architectural families that encode different inductive biases, the trade-offs among ML frameworks, and the mechanics of efficient training. Part III addresses optimization under resource constraint: data selection as a systems problem, model compression through quantization and pruning, hardware acceleration from memory hierarchies through tensor cores, and benchmarking methodology for comparative evaluation. Part IV addresses production: model serving, operational monitoring and lifecycle management, and responsible engineering practice.

    Throughout, quantitative reasoning is the primary instrument. Every design decision is examined in terms of measurable consequences — latency, throughput, memory capacity, and energy — because understanding a system means understanding what constrains it. Readers develop the capacity to diagnose system bottlenecks, apply hardware-aware optimization techniques, and deploy models into production with principled engineering judgment. Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in computer science and engineering, and for practitioners seeking a principled foundation for ML systems design.
