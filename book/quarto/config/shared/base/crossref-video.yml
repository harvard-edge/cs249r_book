  # Principle callouts use mlsysbook-ext/custom-numbered-blocks (numbered + box).
  # Do NOT add key: pri here: Quarto would treat #pri-* divs as floats, wrap them,
  # and use the last paragraph as caption, which breaks the callout box rendering.
  # Refs: \ref{pri-xxx} works in PDF (foldbox emits \label); @pri-xxx in HTML
  # is resolved by custom-numbered-blocks' Pandoc_resolvexref (Cite and inline @).
