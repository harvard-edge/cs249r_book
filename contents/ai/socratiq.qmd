## Welcome to SocratiQ: Your AI Learning Assistant

Welcome to SocratiQ (pronounced "Socratic"), an innovative AI learning assistant integrated throughout this textbook. Named after the Socratic method of teaching, which emphasizes asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking, SocratiQ helps reinforce your learning through interactive quizzes and personalized assistance.

You can enable SocratiQ by clicking the button below:

<!-- Add this to your Quarto document -->
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;">

  <button id="socratiq-toggle" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleSocratiQ()">OFF</button>
</div>

<style>
  /* Toggle button styles */
  .toggle-btn {
    background-color: #ccc; /* Default (OFF) background */
    color: black;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 20px;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    font-size: 16px;

  .toggle-btn.on {
    background-color: green; /* ON background color */
    color: white; /* Text color for ON */
  }
</style>

<script>
  // Function to get the value of a specific cookie
  function getCookie(name) {
    const cookies = document.cookie.split(';').map(cookie => cookie.trim());
    for (const cookie of cookies) {
      const [key, value] = cookie.split('=');
      if (key === name) return value;
    }
    return null;
  }

  // Function to set a cookie
  function setCookie(name, value, days) {
    const expires = new Date(Date.now() + days * 864e5).toUTCString();
    document.cookie = `${name}=${value}; expires=${expires}; path=/`;
  }

  // Initialize the button state based on the "socratiq" cookie
  const toggleButton = document.getElementById('socratiq-toggle');
  const isSocratiQActive = getCookie('socratiq') === 'true';
  if (isSocratiQActive) {
    toggleButton.classList.add('on');
    toggleButton.textContent = 'ON';
  }

  // Function to handle the toggle button click
  function toggleSocratiQ() {
    const isActive = toggleButton.classList.toggle('on');
    toggleButton.textContent = isActive ? 'ON' : 'OFF';
    setCookie('socratiq', isActive, 7); // Save the state in a cookie for 7 days
  }
</script>

SocratiQ's goal is to adapt to your needs while generating targeted questions and engaging in meaningful dialogue about the material. Unlike traditional textbook study, SocratiQ offers an interactive, personalized learning experience that can help you better understand and retain complex concepts.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Enable SocratiQ using the button below or URL parameters
2. Use keyboard shortcut (`Cmd/Ctrl + /`) to open SocratiQ anytime
3. Set your academic level in Settings
4. Start learning! Look for quiz buttons at the end of sections

Please note that this is an experimental feature. We are experimenting with the idea of creating a dynamic and personalized learning experience by harnessing the power of generative AI. We hope that this approach will transform how you interact with and absorb the complex concepts.

## Learning with SocratiQ

As you progress through each section of the textbook, you will find automatically generated quizzes designed to reinforce key concepts. These quizzes typically contain 3-5 questions and take only about 1-2 minutes to complete. These are crafted to check your understanding of the material you've just covered, as shown in @fig-quiz-interface.

After submitting your answers, SocratiQ provides immediate feedback and detailed explanations for each question, as demonstrated in @fig-quiz-feedback.
