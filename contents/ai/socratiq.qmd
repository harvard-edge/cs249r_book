## Welcome to SocratiQ: Your AI Learning Assistant

We're excited to introduce SocratiQ (pronounced "Socratic"), an innovative AI learning assistant integrated throughout this textbook. SocratiQ helps reinforce your learning through interactive quizzes and personalized assistance. SocratiQ's goal is to adapt to your needs while generating targeted questions and engaging in meaningful dialogue about the material. 

Please note that this is an experimental feature. We are experimenting with the idea of creating a dynamic and personalized learning experience by harnessing the power of generative AI. We hope that this approach will transform how you interact with and absorb the complex concepts.

**About AI Responses**: While SocratiQ uses advanced AI to generate quizzes and provide assistance, like all AI systems, it may occasionally provide imperfect or incomplete answers. However, we've designed and tested it to ensure it's effective for supporting your learning journey. If you're unsure about any response, refer to the textbook content or consult your instructor.
