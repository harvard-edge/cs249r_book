  function getCookie(name) {
    const cookies = document.cookie.split(';').map(cookie => cookie.trim());
    for (const cookie of cookies) {
      const [key, value] = cookie.split('=');
      if (key === name) return value;
    }
    return null;
  }

SocratiQ's goal is to adapt to your needs while generating targeted questions and engaging in meaningful dialogue about the material. Unlike traditional textbook study, SocratiQ offers an interactive, personalized learning experience that can help you better understand and retain complex concepts.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Enable SocratiQ using the button below or URL parameters
2. Use keyboard shortcut (`Cmd/Ctrl + /`) to open SocratiQ anytime
3. Set your academic level in Settings
4. Start learning! Look for quiz buttons at the end of sections

Please note that this is an experimental feature. We are experimenting with the idea of creating a dynamic and personalized learning experience by harnessing the power of generative AI. We hope that this approach will transform how you interact with and absorb the complex concepts.

## Learning with SocratiQ {#sec-socratiq-learning}

### Quizzes

As you progress through each section of the textbook, you have the option to ask SocratiQ to automatically generate quizzes tailored to reinforce key concepts. These quizzes are conveniently inserted at the end of every major subsection (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and so on), as illustrated in @fig-quiz-interface.

![Quizzes are generated at the end of every section.](images/png/quiz_button2.png){#fig-quiz-interface}

Each quiz typically consists of 3-5 multiple-choice questions and takes only 1-2 minutes to complete. These questions are designed to assess your understanding of the material covered in the preceding section, as shown in @fig-quiz-questions.

Upon submitting your answers, SocratiQ provides immediate feedback along with detailed explanations for each question, as demonstrated in @fig-quiz-answers.

### Getting Help with Concepts

When you encounter challenging concepts, SocratiQ offers two powerful ways to get help. First, you can select any text from the textbook and ask for a detailed explanation, as demonstrated in @fig-text-selection.

![Selecting specific text to ask for clarification.](images/png/chat_context.png){#fig-text-selection}

Once you've selected the text, you can ask questions about it, and SocratiQ will provide detailed explanations based on that context, as illustrated in @fig-context-explanation.

![Example of how SocratiQ provides explanations based on selected text.](images/png/chat_ask.png){#fig-context-explanation}

@fig-interactive-chat shows the response for the ask in @fig-context-explanation.
