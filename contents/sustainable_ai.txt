Sustainable AI is the development of artificial intelligence systems that minimize environmental impact, use energy efficiently, and consider ethical implications. This includes designing models that require less computational power and reducing the carbon footprint of data centers. Sustainable AI also aims to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI systems.
