The embedded ML landscape is rapidly evolving and poised to enable intelligent applications across a broad spectrum of devices and use cases. This chapter serves as a snapshot of the current state of embedded ML. As algorithms, hardware, and connectivity continue to improve, we can expect embedded devices of all sizes to become increasingly capable, unlocking transformative new applications for artificial intelligence.
