AI is set to dramatically transform the world, much like computers and the Internet revolutionized every aspect of society in the 20th century. From AI systems capable of generating creative content to those accelerating scientific breakthroughs in drug discovery, AI is ushering in a new era—one that may prove even more profound in scope and impact.

With such transformative power comes an equally great responsibility. Just as we expect large-scale, big-tech AI R&D organizations to wield their influence ethically, those of us in academia bear a parallel responsibility: to share our knowledge openly, ensuring it benefits everyone, not just a select few. This conviction led to the creation of this book—an open-source resource aimed at making AI education, particularly in AI engineering and systems, inclusive and accessible to everyone.

My passion for creating, curating, and editing this content has been inspired by great textbooks that have influenced my personal and academic journey. Whether I studied them cover to cover or drew insights from key passages, these resources shaped the way I think. I reflect on the books that shaped my journey: works by Turing Award winners like David Patterson and John Hennessy, pioneers in computer system design, and foundational papers from luminaries like Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio. My hope is that this book inspires students to chart their unique paths.

As I think about the possibilities of harnessing this powerful technology, I am optimistic about what lies ahead for AI and its engineering discipline. AI can democratize access to knowledge, solve global challenges, and inspire creativity in ways we've yet to imagine. To achieve that, however, we must train the next generation of AI engineers and practitioners in ML systems. Put simply, astronauts inspire us to reach for the stars, but rocket scientists make the journey possible. Similarly, skilled AI systems engineers lay the foundation for realizing even the boldest AI visions.

This book is a work in progress, but knowing that even one learner benefits from its content motivates me to continually refine and expand it. To that end, if there's one thing I ask of readers, it's this: please show your support by starring the repository on GitHub [here](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book). Each star ⭐ signals that this mission matters, whether you're a student just beginning your journey, an educator, a practitioner, or a supporter sharing these resources. Together, we can build a thriving community committed to creating a positive impact and ensuring that AI benefits everyone. This small act is more than symbolic—it demonstrates the importance of making AI systems knowledge globally accessible.

This book is dedicated to the loving memory of my father. His passion for education, endless curiosity, generosity in sharing knowledge, and unwavering commitment to excellence inspire me daily to strive for the very best in all I do. It is also dedicated to teachers and mentors everywhere, whose tireless efforts and guidance transform lives every day. Your selfless contributions continue to inspire me.

Last but certainly not least, this work would not be possible without the unwavering support of my wonderful wife and children. Their love, patience, and encouragement form the foundation that enables me to pursue my passion and bring this work to life. For this, and so much more, I am deeply grateful.
