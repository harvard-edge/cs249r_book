# Foreword {.unnumbered}

<div class="foreword-content">

_AI is poised to dramatically transform the world, much like computers and the Internet revolutionized every aspect of society in the 20th century. We stand on the brink of a new generation of technology—one that may prove even more profound in scope and impact._

_With such transformative power comes an equally great responsibility. Just as we expect technology giants to wield their influence ethically for the greater good, those of us in academia bear a parallel obligation to act responsibly. As educators, our duty is to share knowledge in ways that benefit everyone, not just a select few. This book was born out of my conviction that making AI knowledge accessible is essential for ensuring its benefits are inclusive, reaching people from all walks of life._

_Why did I write this book? I have always been deeply inspired by great textbooks. Whether I read them cover to cover or absorbed snippets of their wisdom, these resources shaped the way I think. My hope is that this book inspires students to chart their unique paths in computing, AI systems, or even pure AI theory. For educators, I want this book to serve as a systematic resource, filling a gap where no unified teaching material has existed. And for practitioners, I hope to offer something enduring—bridging principles and practices in a way that stands the test of time, beyond the rapidly shifting trends in AI._

_Above all, I want readers to glimpse the possibilities of harnessing this technology. I am optimistic about what lies ahead for AI and machine learning systems. At their best, these technologies can democratize access to knowledge, solve global challenges, and inspire creativity in ways we've yet to imagine. To achieve that, however, we must train the next generation of engineers, thinkers, and leaders._

_This book is not static—it's meant to be a living resource. Knowing that even one learner, somewhere, is benefiting from it motivates me to improve and expand its content. As such, I am committed to keeping it updated. I think back to the books that shaped my journey: works by turing Award winners like David Patterson and John Hennessy, pioneers in computer system design, and the groundbreaking ideas of luminaries like Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio. Perhaps someone picking up this book will spark an idea that leads to the next generation of world-changing innovations._

_Every chapter of this book has been a lesson for me. Teaching and writing have always been deeply personal endeavors, rooted in my values of curiosity and persistence. My hope is that this book encourages readers to embrace those same values, to think deeply, and to dream boldly._

_I also believe in the power of community-driven learning. By building on the work of others, sharing knowledge, and contributing even small insights, we collectively push the boundaries of what's possible. If there's one thing I ask of readers, it's this: take one idea from this book and share it. Together, we can create a ripple effect of learning. And if you find value here, consider adding a star to this project. Your engagement—no matter how small—helps this vision gain momentum and brings us closer to building a discipline as impactful as computer engineering._

_This book is dedicated to the loving memory of my late father, Vibhishana Rao Janapareddy. His deep passion for education and his unwavering commitment to excellence inspire me daily to hold myself to the highest standards in all I do._

_Thank you for being part of this journey._
