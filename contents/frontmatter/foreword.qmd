# Foreword {.unnumbered}

AI is without a doubt poised to dramatically transform the world, much like computers revolutionized every aspect of our society in the 20th century. We are on the cusp of a new generation of technology—one that may prove to be even bigger in scope and impact.

But with this transformative power comes a profound responsibility. Just as we expect leading technology companies to wield their influence ethically and for the greater good, we in academia have a parallel obligation to act responsibly. As researchers and educators, it is our duty to share knowledge in a way that benefits everyone, not just a select few. This book was born out of my conviction that making knowledge about AI globally accessible is essential to ensuring its benefits are pervasive and inclusive, reaching people from all walks of life.

Why did I write this book? I've always been deeply inspired by great textbooks. Whether I read them cover to cover or simply absorbed snippets of knowledge from them, these resources shaped the way I think and the person I've become today. My hope is that this book can similarly inspire students to pursue their own unique paths in computing, AI systems, or even pure AI theory. For educators, I want this book to serve as a systematic resource—filling a gap where no unified teaching material has existed. And for practitioners, my goal is to offer something more enduring than fast-changing engineering guides, bridging the principles and practices in a way that stands the test of time.

Above all, I want readers to glimpse the incredible possibilities of harnessing this technology. I am deeply optimistic about what lies ahead for AI and machine learning systems. At its best, this technology has the potential to democratize access to knowledge, solve global challenges, and inspire creativity in ways we have yet to imagine.

This book is not static—it's a living resource, and I'm committed to keeping it updated and relevant. Knowing that even one learner, somewhere, is benefiting from it motivates me to improve and expand the material. I think back to the books that shaped me: works by legends like David Patterson and John Hennessy, Turing Award winners in computer system design. Their textbooks guided my journey, as did the revolutionary ideas of AI pioneers like Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio. Perhaps someone picking up this book will spark an idea and create the next generation of world-changing innovations.

Teaching and writing have always been deeply personal pursuits for me. I am a student of my own writing, and every chapter of this book has taught me something new. My approach to learning has always been rooted in curiosity and persistence, and I hope this book encourages readers to embrace those values as well.

I also want to emphasize the power of community-driven learning. By building on the work of others, sharing knowledge, and contributing even small insights, we collectively push the boundaries of what's possible. If there's one thing I ask of readers, it's this: take one idea from this book and share it. Let's create a ripple effect of learning. And if you find value here, consider adding a star to this project. Your engagement—however small—helps this vision gain momentum and brings us closer to creating a discipline as impactful as computer engineering has been.

This book is dedicated to the loving memory of my father, Vibhishana Rao Janapreddi, whose deep passion for education and the sharing of knowledge was matched by his unwavering commitment to holding himself and others to the highest standards of excellence. His example inspires me each day to strive for the same in all that I do.

Thank you for being part of this journey.
