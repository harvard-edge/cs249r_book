# SocratiQ AI {.unnumbered}

## AI Learning Companion

Welcome to SocratiQ (pronounced ``Socratic''), an AI learning assistant seamlessly integrated throughout this resource. Inspired by the Socratic method of teaching—emphasizing thoughtful questions and answers to stimulate critical thinking—SocratiQ is part of our experiment with what we call as _Generative Learning._ By combining interactive quizzes, personalized assistance, and real-time feedback, SocratiQ is meant to reinforce your understanding and help you create new connections. _SocratiQ is still a work in progress, and we welcome your feedback._

You can enable SocratiQ by clicking the button below:

<!-- Add this to your Quarto document -->
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;">
  <label for="socratiq-toggle" style="margin: 0; font-weight: bold;">SocratiQ:</label>
  <button id="socratiq-toggle" class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleSocratiQ()">OFF</button>
</div>

<style>
  /* Toggle button styles */
  .toggle-btn {
    background-color: #ccc; /* Default (OFF) background */
    color: black;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 20px;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    font-size: 16px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease;
  }
  .toggle-btn.on {
    background-color: green; /* ON background color */
    color: white; /* Text color for ON */
  }
</style>

<script>
  // Function to get the value of a specific cookie
  function getCookie(name) {
    const cookies = document.cookie.split(';').map(cookie => cookie.trim());
    for (const cookie of cookies) {
      const [key, value] = cookie.split('=');
      if (key === name) return value;
    }
    return null;
  }

  // Function to set a cookie

    document.cookie = `${name}=${value}; expires=${expires}; path=/`;
  }

  // Initialize the button state based on the "socratiq" cookie
  const toggleButton = document.getElementById('socratiq-toggle');
  const isSocratiQActive = getCookie('socratiq') === 'true';

    toggleButton.textContent = 'ON';
  }

  // Function to handle the toggle button click

    const isActive = toggleButton.classList.toggle('on');
    toggleButton.textContent = isActive ? 'ON' : 'OFF';
    setCookie('socratiq', isActive, 7); // Save the state in a cookie for 7 days
  }

## Direct URL Access
You can directly control SocratiQ by adding `?socratiq=` parameters to your URL:

- To activate: [mlsysbook.ai/?socratiq=true](https://mlsysbook.ai/?socratiq=true)
- To deactivate: [mlsysbook.ai/?socratiq=false](https://mlsysbook.ai/?socratiq=false)

This gives you with quick access to toggle SocratiQ's functionality directly from your browser's address bar if you are on a page and do not want to return here to toggle functionality.
:::

SocratiQ's goal is to adapt to your needs while generating targeted questions and engaging in meaningful dialogue about the material. Unlike traditional textbook study, SocratiQ offers an interactive, personalized learning experience that can help you better understand and retain complex concepts. It is only available as an online feature.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Enable SocratiQ using the button below or URL parameters
2. Use keyboard shortcut (`Cmd/Ctrl + /`) to open SocratiQ anytime
3. Set your academic level in Settings
4. Start learning! Look for quiz buttons at the end of sections

Please note that this is an experimental feature. We are experimenting with the idea of creating a dynamic and personalized learning experience by harnessing the power of generative AI. We hope that this approach will transform how you interact with and absorb the complex concepts.

:::{.callout-warning}
**About AI Responses**: While SocratiQ uses advanced AI to generate quizzes and provide assistance, like all AI systems, it may occasionally provide imperfect or incomplete answers. However, we've designed and tested it to ensure it's effective for supporting your learning journey. If you're unsure about any response, refer to the textbook content or consult your instructor.
:::

Once you've enabled SocratiQ it will always be available when you visit this site.

You can access SocratiQ at any time using a keyboard shortcut shown in @fig-main-shortcut, which brings up the interface shown in @fig-main-interface.

## Learning with SocratiQ {#sec-socratiq-learning}

### Quizzes

As you progress through each section of the textbook, you have the option to ask SocratiQ to automatically generate quizzes tailored to reinforce key concepts. These quizzes are conveniently inserted at the end of every major subsection (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and so on), as illustrated in @fig-quiz-interface.

:::


![Quizzes are generated at the end of every section.](images/png/quiz_button2.png){#fig-quiz-interface}

Each quiz typically consists of 3-5 multiple-choice questions and takes only 1-2 minutes to complete. These questions are designed to assess your understanding of the material covered in the preceding section, as shown in @fig-quiz-questions.

Upon submitting your answers, SocratiQ provides immediate feedback along with detailed explanations for each question, as demonstrated in @fig-quiz-answers.

### Example Learning Flow

1. Read a section
2. Select challenging text → Ask SocratiQ for explanation
3. Take the section quiz
4. Review related content suggestions
5. Track progress in dashboard

### Getting Help with Concepts

When you encounter challenging concepts, SocratiQ offers two powerful ways to get help. First, you can select any text from the textbook and ask for a detailed explanation, as demonstrated in @fig-text-selection.

![Selecting specific text to ask for clarification.](images/png/chat_context.png){#fig-text-selection}

Once you've selected the text, you can ask questions about it, and SocratiQ will provide detailed explanations based on that context, as illustrated in @fig-context-explanation.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
![Example of how SocratiQ provides explanations based on selected text.](images/png/chat_ask.png){#fig-context-explanation}
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
![Example of how SocratiQ provides explanations based on selected text.](images/png/chat_ask.png){#fig-context-explanation  width=60%}
:::

@fig-interactive-chat shows the response for the ask in @fig-context-explanation.

Additionally, you can also reference Sections, as shown in @fig-reference-sections, Sub-sections and keywords directly as you converse with SocratiQ. Use the `@` symbol to reference a section, sub-section or keyword.
You can also click the `+ Context` button right above the input.
