## Shared Labs {.unnumbered}

The labs in this section cover topics and techniques that are applicable across different hardware platforms. These labs are designed to be independent of specific boards, allowing you to focus on the fundamental concepts and algorithms used in (tiny) ML applications.

By exploring these shared labs, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the common challenges and solutions in embedded machine learning. The knowledge and skills acquired here will be valuable regardless of the specific hardware you work with in the future.
