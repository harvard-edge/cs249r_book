   - Download and install
     - Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
     - Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/Windows) for your specific OS.
     - [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/1.0/)
     
     - Configure the Arduino IDE for the [Arduino Nicla Vision](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-mbed_nicla) and [XIAO ESP32S3 Sense](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/#software-setup) boards.
2. **OpenMV IDE (optional)**
   
   - Download and install the [OpenMV IDE](https://openmv.io/pages/download) for your operating system.
   - Configure the OpenMV IDE for the [Arduino Nicla Vision](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nicla-vision/getting-started/).
3. **Edge Impulse Studio**
   - Sign up for a free account on the [Edge Impulse Studio](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/login).
   
   - Install [Edge Impulse CLI](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/tools/edge-impulse-cli/cli-installation)
   
   - Follow the guides to connect your [Arduino Nicla Vision](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-ai-hardware/mcu/arduino-nicla-vision) and [XIAO ESP32S3 Sense](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-ai-hardware/mcu/seeed-xiao-esp32s3-sense) boards to Edge Impulse Studio.
4. **Raspberry Pi OS**
 - Download and install the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

## Network Connectivity

Some projects may require internet connectivity for data collection or model deployment. Ensure your development environment connection is stable through Wi-Fi or Ethernet. For the Raspberry Pi, having a Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection is necessary for remote operation without the necessity to plug in a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. 

- For the Arduino Nicla Vision, you can use the onboard Wi-Fi module to connect to a wireless network.

- For the XIAO ESP32S3 Sense, you can use the onboard Wi-Fi module or connect an external Wi-Fi or Ethernet module using the available pins.

- For the Raspberry Pi, you can use the onboard Wi-Fi module to connect an external Wi-Fi or Ethernet module using the available connector. 

## Conclusion

With your hardware and software set up, you're ready to embark on your embedded machine learning journey. The hands-on labs will guide you through various projects, covering topics like image classification, object detection, keyword spotting, and motion classification.
