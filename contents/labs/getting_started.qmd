# Getting Started {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the exciting world of embedded machine learning and TinyML! In this hands-on lab series, you'll explore various projects that demonstrate the power of running machine learning models on resource-constrained devices. Before diving into the projects, let's ensure you have the necessary hardware and software set up.

## Hardware Requirements

To follow along with the hands-on labs, you'll need the following hardware:

1. **Arduino Nicla Vision board**
   - The Arduino Nicla Vision is a powerful, compact board designed for professional-grade computer vision and audio applications. It features a high-quality camera module, a digital microphone, and an IMU, making it suitable for demanding projects in industries such as robotics, automation, and surveillance.
