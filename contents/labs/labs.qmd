# Hardware Kits {.unnumbered}

The following labs provide a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience deploying TinyML models onto real embedded devices. In contrast to working with large models that require data center-scale resources, these labs allow you to interact directly with the hardware and software, giving you a tangible understanding of the challenges and opportunities in embedded AI.

These lab exercises are the contributions of [Marcelo Rovai](https://github.com/Mjrovai).
