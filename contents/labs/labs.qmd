# Overview {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the hands-on labs section where you'll explore deploying ML models onto real embedded devices, which will offer a practical introduction to ML systems. Unlike traditional approaches with large-scale models, these labs focus on interacting directly with both hardware and software. They help us show case various sensor modalities across different application use cases. This approach provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of deploying AI on real physical systems.
