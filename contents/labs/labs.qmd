# Overview {.unnumbered}

The following labs offer a unique chance to gain hands-on experience with machine learning (ML) systems by deploying TinyML models onto real embedded devices. Instead of working with large models that need data center-scale resources, you'll interact directly with both hardware and software. These exercises cover different sensor modalities, giving you exposure to a variety of applications. This approach helps you understand the real-world challenges and opportunities in deploying AI on real systems.
