# Nicla Vision {.unnumbered}

These labs provide a unique opportunity to gain practical experience with machine learning (ML) systems. Unlike working with large models that require data center-scale resources, these exercises allow you to directly interact with both hardware and software using TinyML. This hands-on approach gives you a tangible understanding of the challenges and opportunities in embedded AI.
