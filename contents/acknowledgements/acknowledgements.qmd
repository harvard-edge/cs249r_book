# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

Assembling this book has been a long journey, spanning several years of hard work. The initial idea for this book sprang from the [TinyML edX course](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/harvardx-tiny-machine-learning), and its realization would not have been possible without the invaluable contributions of countless individuals. We are deeply indebted to the researchers whose groundbreaking work laid the foundation for this book.

## Individual Contributors

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the open source community of learners, teachers and sharers. Whether you contributed an entire section, a single sentence, or merely corrected a typo, your efforts have enhanced this book. We deeply appreciate everyone's time, expertise, and commitment. This book is as much yours as it is ours.

Special thanks go to Professor Vijay Janapa Reddi, whose belief in the transformative power of open-source communities and invaluable guidance have been our guiding light from the outset.

We also owe a great deal to the team at GitHub and Quarto. You've revolutionized the way people collaborate, and this book stands as a testament to what can be achieved when barriers to global cooperation are removed.

## To Our Readers

To all who pick up this book, we want to thank you! We wrote it with you in mind, hoping to provoke thought, inspire questions, and perhaps even ignite a spark of inspiration. After all, what is the point of writing if no one is reading?
