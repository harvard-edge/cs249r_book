# About the Book {.unnumbered}

## Overview

Welcome to this collaborative project initiated by the CS249r Machine Learning Systems class at Harvard University. Our goal is to make this book a community resource that assists educators and learners in understanding ML systems. The book will be regularly updated to reflect new insights into ML systems and effective teaching methods.

## Topics Explored

This book offers a comprehensive look at various aspects of machine learning systems. We cover the entire end-to-end ML systems workflow, starting with fundamental concepts and progressing through data engineering, AI frameworks, and model training.

You'll learn about optimizing models for efficiency, deploying AI on various hardware platforms, and benchmarking performance. The book also explores more advanced topics like security, privacy, responsible and sustainable AI, robust and generative AI, and the social impact of AI. By the end, you'll have a solid foundation and practical insights into both the technical and ethical dimensions of machine learning.

By the time you finish this book, we hope that you'll have a foundational understanding of machine learning and its applications. You'll also learn about real-world implementations of machine learning systems and gain practical experience through project-based labs and assignments.

### **Who Should Read This**

This book is tailored for individuals at various stages in their interaction with machine learning systems. It starts with the fundamentals and progresses to more advanced topics pertinent to the ML community and broader research areas. The most relevant audiences include:

* **Students in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering:** Senior and graduate students in these fields will find this book invaluable. It introduces the techniques used in designing and building ML systems, focusing on fundamentals rather than depthâ€”typically the focus of classroom instruction. This book aims to provide the necessary background and context, enabling instructors to delve deeper into advanced topics. An important aspect is the end-to-end focus, often overlooked in traditional curricula.

* **Systems Engineers:** For engineers, this book serves as a guide to understanding the challenges of intelligent applications, especially on resource-constrained ML platforms. It covers the conceptual framework and practical components that constitute an ML system, extending beyond specific areas you might specialize in at your job.

* **Researchers and Academics:** Researchers will find that this book addresses the unique challenges of running machine learning algorithms on diverse platforms. Efficiency is becoming increasingly important; understanding algorithms alone is not sufficient, as a deeper understanding of systems is necessary to build more efficient models. For researchers, the book cites seminal papers, guiding you towards foundational works that have shaped the field and drawing connections between various areas with significant implications for your work.
