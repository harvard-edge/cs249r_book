## Hardware Resilience

Explanation: With the proliferation of TinyML on edge devices, the hardware on which these models run can be exposed to various environmental factors and wear-and-tear. Ensuring hardware resilience is crucial to maintain consistent AI performance.

### Compute Faults

Description: Discusses issues related to faults in the computation units, such as CPUs, GPUs, and custom accelerators. This can include issues like overheating, transistor failures, or other malfunctions.

### Memory Faults

Description: Addresses faults in the memory components of a system, including RAM, cache, and storage. Topics can include bit flips, wear-out, and other memory-related issues.

## Software Resilience

Explanation: Software forms the backbone of any AI system. Ensuring its resilience means that the system can handle unexpected inputs, software bugs, or other issues without catastrophic failure.

### Framework Faults

Description: Discusses potential issues in the software stack, from the OS to the AI framework. This can include bugs, version incompatibilities, or other software-related problems.

### Faulty Inputs

Description: Explores how AI systems can handle unexpected or corrupted inputs. This is especially important for systems in the real world where input data can be noisy or unreliable.

## Model Resilience

As the core of any AI system, the model's resilience to various challenges, from adversarial attacks to real-world data shifts, is paramount for reliable operation.

### Worst-case Faults

Description: Investigates the model's behavior under worst-case scenarios, such as extreme data values or conditions outside the training distribution.

### Adversarial Attacks 

Description: Discusses potential threats where malicious actors intentionally manipulate inputs to deceive the AI model, and strategies to defend against these attacks.
