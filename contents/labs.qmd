# HANDS-ON LABS

The following labs provide a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience deploying TinyML models onto real embedded devices. In contrast to working with large models that require data center-scale resources, these labs allow you to interact directly with the hardware and software, giving you a tangible understanding of the challenges and opportunities in embedded AI.

From setting up the [Nicla Vision](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nicla-vision) board to implementing computer vision, audio processing, and motion classification tasks using tools like [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers) and Arduino firmware, you'll develop practical skills in deploying efficient AI models on resource-constrained devices. By completing these labs, you'll appreciate the beauty of TinyML—the ability to hold cutting-edge AI technology in the palm of your hand. This hands-on perspective is invaluable for understanding the end-to-end workflow of embedded AI systems and will prepare you for real-world applications where model efficiency, robustness, and responsiveness are paramount. In the future, we plan to add a few other platforms. Please stay tuned!
