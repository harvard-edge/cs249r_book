## Neural Networks

Deep learning draws inspiration from the neural networks of the human brain to create patterns used in decision-making. This section delves into the foundational concepts that make up deep learning, providing insights into the more complex topics discussed later in this primer.

Neural networks serve as the foundation of deep learning, inspired by the biological neural networks in the human brain to process and analyze data hierarchically. Below, we examine the primary components and structures commonly found in neural networks.

### Perceptrons

The perceptron is the basic unit or node that serves as the foundation for more complex structures. A perceptron takes various inputs, applies weights and a bias to these inputs, and then uses an activation function to produce an output.

![Perceptron ([source](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Rosenblattperceptron.png/500px-Rosenblattperceptron.png))](./images/png/Rosenblattperceptron.png){#fig-perceptron}

Conceived in the 1950s, perceptrons paved the way for the development of more intricate neural networks and have been a fundamental building block in the field of deep learning.

### Multi-layer Perceptrons

Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are an evolution of the single-layer perceptron model, featuring multiple layers of nodes connected in a feedforward manner. These layers include an input layer for data reception, several hidden layers for data processing, and an output layer for final result generation. MLPs are skilled at identifying non-linear relationships and use a backpropagation technique for training, where weights are optimized through a gradient descent algorithm.

![Multilayer Perceptron](https://www.nomidl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-7.png){width=70%}

#### Forward Pass

The forward pass is the initial phase where data moves through the network from the input to the output layer. During this phase, each layer performs specific computations on the input data, using weights and biases before passing the resulting values to subsequent layers. The final output of this phase is used to compute the loss, indicating the difference between the predicted output and actual target values.

#### Backward Pass (Backpropagation)

Backpropagation is a key algorithm in training deep neural networks. This phase involves calculating the gradient of the loss function concerning each weight by using the chain rule, effectively moving backward through the network. The gradients calculated in this step guide the adjustment of weights with the objective of minimizing the loss function, thereby enhancing the network's performance with each iteration of training.

Grasping these foundational concepts paves the way to understanding more intricate deep learning architectures and techniques, fostering the development of more sophisticated and efficacious applications, especially within the realm of embedded AI systems.

### Model Architectures

Deep learning architectures refer to the various structured approaches that dictate how neurons and layers are organized and interact in neural networks. These architectures have evolved to tackle different problems and data types effectively. This section offers an overview of some well-known deep learning architectures and their characteristics.

#### Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)

MLPs are basic deep learning architectures, comprising three or more layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. These layers are fully connected, meaning each neuron in a layer is linked to every neuron in the preceding and following layers. MLPs can model intricate functions and are used in a broad array of tasks, such as regression, classification, and pattern recognition. Their capacity to learn non-linear relationships through backpropagation makes them a versatile instrument in the deep learning toolkit.

In embedded AI systems, MLPs can function as compact models for simpler tasks like sensor data analysis or basic pattern recognition, where computational resources are limited. Their ability to learn non-linear relationships with relatively less complexity makes them a suitable choice for embedded systems.

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are mainly used in image and video recognition tasks. This architecture employs convolutional layers that apply a series of filters to the input data to identify features like edges, corners, and textures. A typical CNN also includes pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions of the data, and fully connected layers for classification. CNNs have proven highly effective in tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and computer vision applications.

In embedded AI, CNNs are crucial for image and video recognition tasks, where real-time processing is often needed. They can be optimized for embedded systems by using techniques like quantization and pruning to minimize memory usage and computational demands, enabling efficient object detection and facial recognition functionalities in devices with limited computational resources.

#### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are suitable for sequential data analysis, like time series forecasting and natural language processing. In this architecture, connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence, allowing information to be carried across sequences through hidden state vectors. Variants of RNNs include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), designed to capture longer dependencies in sequence data.

In embedded systems, these networks can be used in voice recognition systems, predictive maintenance, or in IoT devices where sequential data patterns are common. Optimizations specific to embedded platforms can assist in managing their typically high computational and memory requirements.

#### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs consist of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, trained simultaneously through adversarial training [@goodfellow2020generative]. The generator produces data that tries to mimic the real data distribution, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real and generated data. GANs are widely used in image generation, style transfer, and data augmentation.

In embedded settings, GANs could be used for on-device data augmentation to enhance the training of models directly on the embedded device, enabling continual learning and adaptation to new data without the need for cloud computing resources.

#### Autoencoders

Autoencoders are neural networks used for data compression and noise reduction [@bank2023autoencoders]. They are structured to encode input data into a lower-dimensional representation and then decode it back to its original form. Variants like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) introduce probabilistic layers that allow for generative properties, finding applications in image generation and anomaly detection.

Using autoencoders can help in efficient data transmission and storage, improving the overall performance of embedded systems with limited computational and memory resources.

#### Transformer Networks

Transformer networks have emerged as a powerful architecture, especially in natural language processing [@vaswani2017attention]. These networks use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the influence of different input words on each output word, enabling parallel computation and capturing intricate patterns in data. Transformer networks have led to state-of-the-art results in tasks like language translation, summarization, and text generation.

These networks can be optimized to perform language-related tasks directly on-device. For example, transformers can be used in embedded systems for real-time translation services or voice-assisted interfaces, where latency and computational efficiency are crucial. Techniques such as model distillation can be employed to deploy these networks on embedded devices with limited resources.

Each of these architectures serves specific purposes and excels in different domains, offering a rich toolkit for addressing diverse problems in the realm of embedded AI systems. Understanding the nuances of these architectures is crucial in designing effective and efficient deep learning models for various applications.

### Traditional ML vs Deep Learning
