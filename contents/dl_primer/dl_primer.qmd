### Brief History of Deep Learning

The idea of deep learning has origins in early artificial neural networks. It has experienced several cycles of interest, starting with the introduction of the Perceptron in the 1950s [@rosenblatt1957perceptron], followed by the invention of backpropagation algorithms in the 1980s [@rumelhart1986learning].

The term "deep learning" became prominent in the 2000s, characterized by advances in computational power and data accessibility. Important milestones include the successful training of deep networks like AlexNet [@krizhevsky2012imagenet] by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hinton_4791679.cfm), a leading figure in AI, and the renewed focus on neural networks as effective tools for data analysis and modeling.

Deep learning has recently seen exponential growth, transforming various industries. Computational growth followed an 18-month doubling pattern from 1952 to 2010, which then accelerated to a 6-month cycle from 2010 to 2022, as shown in @fig-trends. Concurrently, we saw the emergence of large-scale models between 2015 and 2022, appearing 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster and following a 10-month doubling cycle.

![Growth of deep learning models.](https://epochai.org/assets/images/posts/2022/compute-trends.png){#fig-trends}

Multiple factors have contributed to this surge, including advancements in computational power, the abundance of big data, and improvements in algorithmic designs. First, the growth of computational capabilities, especially the arrival of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) [@jouppi2017datacenter], has significantly sped up the training and inference times of deep learning models. These hardware improvements have enabled the construction and training of more complex, deeper networks than what was possible in earlier years.

Second, the digital revolution has yielded a wealth of big data, offering rich material for deep learning models to learn from and excel in tasks such as image and speech recognition, language translation, and game playing. Large, labeled datasets have been key in refining and successfully deploying deep learning applications in real-world settings.

Additionally, collaborations and open-source efforts have nurtured a dynamic community of researchers and practitioners, accelerating advancements in deep learning techniques. Innovations like deep reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and generative adversarial networks have broadened the scope of what is achievable with deep learning, opening new possibilities in various sectors, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.

Combining deep learning algorithms and embedded systems has laid the groundwork for intelligent, autonomous devices capable of advanced on-device data processing and analysis. Deep learning aids in extracting complex patterns and information from input data, which is essential in developing smart embedded systems, from household appliances to industrial machinery. This collaboration aims to usher in a new era of intelligent, interconnected devices that can learn and adapt to user behavior and environmental conditions, optimizing performance and offering unprecedented convenience and efficiency.

## Neural Networks

Deep learning draws inspiration from the human brain's neural networks to create decision-making patterns. This section delves into the foundational concepts of deep learning, providing insights into the more complex topics discussed later in this primer.

Neural networks serve as the foundation of deep learning, inspired by the biological neural networks in the human brain to process and analyze data hierarchically. Below, we examine the primary components and structures in neural networks.

### Perceptrons

The Perceptron is the basic unit or node that is the foundation for more complex structures. It takes various inputs, applies weights and biases to them, and then uses an activation function to produce an output. @fig-perceptron illustrates the building blocks of a perceptron. In simple terms, think of a perceptron as a tiny decision-maker that learns to make a binary decision (e.g. 'yes' or 'no'). It takes in numbers as inputs (`x_1, x_2, ...`), each representing a feature of an object we wish to analyze (an image for example). Then it multiplies each input by a weight, adds them up, and if the total is high enough (crosses a certain threshold), it returns "yes" as an asnwer, otherwise, it outputs "no."

![Perceptron. Credit: Wikimedia - Chrislb.](images/png/Rosenblattperceptron.png){#fig-perceptron}

Conceived in the 1950s, perceptrons paved the way for developing more intricate neural networks and have been a fundamental building block in deep learning.

### Multilayer Perceptrons

Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are an evolution of the single-layer perceptron model, featuring multiple layers of nodes connected in a feedforward manner, as shown in @fig-mlp. These layers include an input layer for data reception, several hidden layers for data processing, and an output layer for final result generation. MLPs are skilled at identifying non-linear relationships and use a backpropagation technique for training, where weights are optimized through a gradient descent algorithm.

![Multilayer Perceptron. Credit: Wikimedia - Charlie.](https://www.nomidl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-7.png){width=70%, #fig-mlp}

#### Forward Pass

The forward pass is the initial phase where data moves through the network from the input to the output layer. During this phase, each layer performs specific computations on the input data, using weights and biases before passing the resulting values to subsequent layers. The final output of this phase is used to compute the loss, indicating the difference between the predicted output and actual target values.

@vid-nn below explains how neural networks work using handwritten digit recognition as an example application. It also touches on the math underlying neural nets.

:::

#### Backward Pass (Backpropagation)

Backpropagation is a key algorithm in training deep neural networks. This phase involves calculating the gradient of the loss function concerning each weight using the chain rule, effectively moving backward through the network. The gradients calculated in this step guide the adjustment of weights to minimize the loss function, thereby enhancing the network's performance with each iteration of training.

Grasping these foundational concepts paves the way to understanding more intricate deep learning architectures and techniques, fostering the development of more sophisticated and productive applications, especially within embedded AI systems.

### Model Architectures

Deep learning architectures refer to the various structured approaches that dictate how neurons and layers are organized and interact in neural networks. These architectures have evolved to tackle different problems and data types effectively. This section overviews some well-known deep learning architectures and their characteristics.

#### Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)

MLPs are basic deep learning architectures comprising three layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. These layers are fully connected, meaning each neuron in a layer is linked to every neuron in the preceding and following layers. MLPs can model intricate functions and are used in various tasks, such as regression, classification, and pattern recognition. Their capacity to learn non-linear relationships through backpropagation makes them a versatile instrument in the deep learning toolkit.

In embedded AI systems, MLPs can function as compact models for simpler tasks like sensor data analysis or basic pattern recognition, where computational resources are limited. Their ability to learn non-linear relationships with relatively less complexity makes them a suitable choice for embedded systems.

#### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are suitable for sequential data analysis, like time series forecasting and natural language processing. In this architecture, connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence, allowing information to be carried across sequences through hidden state vectors. Variants of RNNs include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), designed to capture longer dependencies in sequence data.

These networks can be used in voice recognition systems, predictive maintenance, or IoT devices where sequential data patterns are common. Optimizations specific to embedded platforms can assist in managing their typically high computational and memory requirements.

#### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs consist of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, trained simultaneously through adversarial training [@goodfellow2020generative]. The generator produces data that tries to mimic the real data distribution, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real and generated data. GANs are widely used in image generation, style transfer, and data augmentation.

In embedded settings, GANs could be used for on-device data augmentation to enhance the training of models directly on the embedded device, enabling continual learning and adaptation to new data without the need for cloud computing resources.

#### Autoencoders

Autoencoders are neural networks for data compression and noise reduction [@bank2023autoencoders]. They are structured to encode input data into a lower-dimensional representation and then decode it back to its original form. Variants like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) introduce probabilistic layers that allow for generative properties, finding applications in image generation and anomaly detection.

Using autoencoders can help in efficient data transmission and storage, improving the overall performance of embedded systems with limited computational and memory resources.

#### Transformer Networks

Transformer networks have emerged as a powerful architecture, especially in natural language processing [@vaswani2017attention]. These networks use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the influence of different input words on each output word, enabling parallel computation and capturing intricate patterns in data. Transformer networks have led to state-of-the-art results in tasks like language translation, summarization, and text generation.

These networks can be optimized to perform language-related tasks directly on the device. For example, transformers can be used in embedded systems for real-time translation services or voice-assisted interfaces, where latency and computational efficiency are crucial. Techniques such as model distillation can be employed to deploy these networks on embedded devices with limited resources.

These architectures serve specific purposes and excel in different domains, offering a rich toolkit for addressing diverse problems in embedded AI systems. Understanding the nuances of these architectures is crucial in designing effective and efficient deep learning models for various applications.

### Traditional ML vs Deep Learning

To briefly highlight the differences, @tbl-mlvsdl illustrates the contrasting characteristics between traditional ML and deep learning:

| Aspect                     | Traditional ML                                      | Deep Learning                                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Requirements          | Low to Moderate (efficient with smaller datasets)   | High (requires large datasets for nuanced learning)    |
| Model Complexity           | Moderate (suitable for well-defined problems)       | High (detects intricate patterns, suited for complex tasks) |
| Computational Resources    | Low to Moderate (cost-effective, less resource-intensive) | High (demands substantial computational power and resources)   |
| Deployment Speed           | Fast (quicker training and deployment cycles)       | Slow (prolonged training times, especially with larger datasets)   |
| Interpretability           | High (clear insights into decision pathways)        | Low (complex layered structures, "black box" nature)   |
| Maintenance                | Easier (simple to update and maintain)              | Complex (requires more efforts in maintenance and updates)    |

### Choosing Traditional ML vs. DL

#### Data Availability and Volume

**Amount of Data:** Traditional machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees or Naive Bayes, are often more suitable when data availability is limited. They offer robust predictions even with smaller datasets. This is particularly true in medical diagnostics for disease prediction and customer segmentation in marketing.

**Data Diversity and Quality:** Traditional machine learning algorithms often work well with structured data (the input to the model is a set of features, ideally independent of each other) but may require significant preprocessing effort (i.e., feature engineering). On the other hand, deep learning takes the approach of automatically performing feature engineering as part of the model architecture. This approach enables the construction of end-to-end models capable of directly mapping from unstructured input data (such as text, audio, and images) to the desired output without relying on simplistic heuristics that have limited effectiveness. However, this results in larger models demanding more data and computational resources. In noisy data, the necessity for larger datasets is further emphasized when utilizing Deep Learning.

#### Complexity of the Problem

**Problem Granularity:** Problems that are simple to moderately complex, which may involve linear or polynomial relationships between variables, often find a better fit with traditional machine learning methods.

**Hierarchical Feature Representation:** Deep learning models are excellent in tasks that require hierarchical feature representation, such as image and speech recognition. However, not all problems require this complexity, and traditional machine learning algorithms may sometimes offer simpler and equally effective solutions.

#### Hardware and Computational Resources

**Resource Constraints:** The availability of computational resources often influences the choice between traditional ML and deep learning. The former is generally less resource-intensive and thus preferable in environments with hardware limitations or budget constraints.

**Scalability and Speed:** Traditional machine learning algorithms, like support vector machines (SVM), often allow for faster training times and easier scalability, which is particularly beneficial in projects with tight timelines and growing data volumes.

#### Regulatory Compliance

Regulatory compliance is crucial in various industries, requiring adherence to guidelines and best practices such as the GDPR in the EU. Traditional ML models, due to their inherent interpretability, often align better with these regulations, especially in sectors like finance and healthcare.

#### Interpretability

Understanding the decision-making process is easier with traditional machine learning techniques than deep learning models, which function as "black boxes," making it challenging to trace decision pathways.

### Making an Informed Choice

Given the constraints of embedded AI systems, understanding the differences between traditional ML techniques and deep learning becomes essential. Both avenues offer unique advantages, and their distinct characteristics often dictate the choice of one over the other in different scenarios.

Despite this, deep learning has steadily outperformed traditional machine learning methods in several key areas due to abundant data, computational advancements, and proven effectiveness in complex tasks. Here are some specific reasons why we focus on deep learning:

1. **Superior Performance in Complex Tasks:** Deep learning models, particularly deep neural networks, excel in tasks where the relationships between data points are incredibly intricate. Tasks like image and speech recognition, language translation, and playing complex games like Go and Chess have seen significant advancements primarily through deep learning algorithms.

2. **Efficient Handling of Unstructured Data:** Unlike traditional machine learning methods, deep learning can more effectively process unstructured data. This is crucial in today's data landscape, where the vast majority of data, such as text, images, and videos, is unstructured.

3. **Leveraging Big Data:** With the availability of big data, deep learning models can learn and improve continually. These models excel at utilizing large datasets to enhance their predictive accuracy, a limitation in traditional machine-learning approaches.

4. **Hardware Advancements and Parallel Computing:** The advent of powerful GPUs and the availability of cloud computing platforms have enabled the rapid training of deep learning models. These advancements have addressed one of deep learning's significant challenges: the need for substantial computational resources.

5. **Dynamic Adaptability and Continuous Learning:** Deep learning models can dynamically adapt to new information or data. They can be trained to generalize their learning to new, unseen data, crucial in rapidly evolving fields like autonomous driving or real-time language translation.

While deep learning has gained significant traction, it's essential to understand that traditional machine learning is still relevant. As we delve deeper into the intricacies of deep learning, we will also highlight situations where traditional machine learning methods may be more appropriate due to their simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability. By focusing on deep learning in this text, we aim to equip readers with the knowledge and tools to tackle modern, complex problems across various domains while also providing insights into the comparative advantages and appropriate application scenarios for deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques.
