It does not introduce new technical concepts, system components, or operational implications that would require active understanding or application. Instead, it recaps previously discussed ideas, such as scaling laws, trade-offs, and efficiency principles, which have already been covered in detail in earlier sections with quizzes. Therefore, a quiz is not needed for this section as it primarily serves to reinforce the chapter's overarching themes and does not present new material that would benefit from additional assessment."
