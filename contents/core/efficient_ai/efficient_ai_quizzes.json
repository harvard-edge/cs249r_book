              "Optimization efforts always lead to proportional benefits.",
              "Each additional improvement requires exponentially more effort and resources for smaller benefits.",

            "answer": "Equity concerns arise because advanced hardware and optimization techniques are often concentrated in well-funded regions, limiting access to efficiency gains in low-resource areas. This can hinder innovation and accessibility in underrepresented regions, highlighting the need for democratization efforts.",
