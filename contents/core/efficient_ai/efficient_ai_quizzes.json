            "answer": "Diminishing returns in ML optimization mean that as systems become more refined, each additional improvement requires exponentially more effort and resources, yielding smaller benefits. Recognizing these limits is crucial to avoid over-optimization, which can lead to wasted resources and reduced adaptability, complicating future system updates.",

            ],
            "answer": "The correct answer is B. Extreme efficiency can lead to diminishing returns, where costs outweigh benefits. This challenge arises because additional gains in efficiency often require sophisticated techniques and resources, which may not provide proportional benefits.",

            "answer": "Equity concerns in ML efficiency arise because resources needed for efficient systems, like advanced hardware and curated datasets, are often concentrated in well-funded regions, limiting access in low-resource areas. This disparity affects who can leverage efficiency gains, potentially stifling innovation and inclusivity in AI capabilities.",

Instead, it reinforces the chapter's overarching narrative, which has already been explored in depth through previous sections and their associated quizzes.

It seems to be a placeholder for upcoming materials such as slides, videos, and exercises, which means it likely serves as a context-setting or organizational section rather than one that delves into the technical depth necessary for a self-check quiz. Therefore, creating a self-check quiz for this section would not be pedagogically valuable at this time."
