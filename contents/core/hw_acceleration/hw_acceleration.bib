	abstract     = {Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC—called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) — deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95},

	abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently widely used for many artificial intelligence (AI) applications including computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics. While DNNs deliver state-of-the-art accuracy on many AI tasks, it comes at the cost of high computational complexity. Accordingly, techniques that enable efficient processing of DNNs to improve energy efficiency and throughput without sacrificing application accuracy or increasing hardware cost are critical to the wide deployment of DNNs in AI systems. This article aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial and survey about the recent advances towards the goal of enabling efficient processing of DNNs. Specifically, it will provide an overview of DNNs, discuss various hardware platforms and architectures that support DNNs, and highlight key trends in reducing the computation cost of DNNs either solely via hardware design changes or via joint hardware design and DNN algorithm changes. It will also summarize various development resources that enable researchers and practitioners to quickly get started in this field, and highlight important benchmarking metrics and design considerations that should be used for evaluating the rapidly growing number of DNN hardware designs, optionally including algorithmic co-designs, being proposed in academia and industry. The reader will take away the following concepts from this article: understand the key design considerations for DNNs; be able to evaluate different DNN hardware implementations with benchmarks and comparison metrics; understand the trade-offs between various hardware architectures and platforms; be able to evaluate the utility of various DNN design techniques for efficient processing; and understand recent implementation trends and opportunities.},

	abstract     = {Over the last years, the computational power of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has grown dramatically, reaching the level of desktop computers available not long ago. While standard smartphone apps are no longer a problem for them, there is still a group of tasks that can easily challenge even high-end devices, namely running artificial intelligence algorithms. In this paper, we present a study of the current state of deep learning in the Android ecosystem and describe available frameworks, programming models and the limitations of running AI on smartphones. We give an overview of the hardware acceleration resources available on four main mobile chipset platforms: Qualcomm, HiSilicon, MediaTek and Samsung. Additionally, we present the real-world performance results of different mobile SoCs collected with AI Benchmark that are covering all main existing hardware configurations.}

	abstract     = {Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC—called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) — deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95},

	abstract     = {Datacenter workloads demand high computational capabilities, flexibility, power efficiency, and low cost. It is challenging to improve all of these factors simultaneously. To advance datacenter capabilities beyond what commodity server designs can provide, we have designed and built a composable, reconfigurablefabric to accelerate portions of large-scale software services. Each instantiation of the fabric consists of a 6x8 2-D torus of high-end Stratix V FPGAs embedded into a half-rack of 48 machines. One FPGA is placed into each server, accessible through PCIe, and wired directly to other FPGAs with pairs of 10 Gb SAS cables In this paper, we describe a medium-scale deployment of this fabric on a bed of 1,632 servers, and measure its efficacy in accelerating the Bing web search engine. We describe the requirements and architecture of the system, detail the critical engineering challenges and solutions needed to make the system robust in the presence of failures, and measure the performance, power, and resilience of the system when ranking candidate documents. Under high load, the largescale reconfigurable fabric improves the ranking throughput of each server by a factor of 95},

In order to reduce the burden on physicians and improve the segmentation accuracy, the computer-aided detection (CAD) systems need to be developed. Due to the powerful feature learning ability of the deep learning technology, many deep learning-based methods have been applied to the brain tumor segmentation CAD systems and achieved satisfactory accuracy. However, deep learning neural networks have high computational complexity, and the brain tumor segmentation process consumes significant time. Therefore, in order to achieve the high segmentation accuracy of brain tumors and obtain the segmentation results efficiently, it is very demanding to speed up the segmentation process of brain tumors.},

	abstract     = {Logic synthesis is a crucial step in electronic design automation tools. The rapid developments of reinforcement learning (RL) have enabled the automated exploration of logic synthesis. Existing RL based methods may lead to data inefficiency, and the exploration approaches for FPGA and ASIC technology mapping in recent works lack the flexibility of the learning process. This work proposes ESE, a reinforcement learning based framework to efficiently learn the logic synthesis process. The framework supports the modeling of logic optimization and technology mapping for FPGA and ASIC. The optimization for the execution time of the synthesis script is also considered. For the modeling of FPGA mapping, the logic optimization and technology mapping are combined to be learned in a flexible way. For the modeling of ASIC mapping, the standard cell based optimization and LUT optimization operations are incorporated into the ASIC synthesis flow. To improve the utilization of samples, the Proximal Policy Optimization model is adopted. Furthermore, the framework is enhanced by supporting MIG based synthesis exploration. Experiments show that for FPGA technology mapping on the VTR benchmark, the average LUT-Level-Product and script runtime are improved by more than 18.3},

	abstract     = {The rapidly-changing deep learning landscape presents a unique opportunity for building inference accelerators optimized for specific datacenter-scale workloads. We propose Full-stack Accelerator Search Technique (FAST), a hardware accelerator search framework that defines a broad optimization environment covering key design decisions within the hardware-software stack, including hardware datapath, software scheduling, and compiler passes such as operation fusion and tensor padding. In this paper, we analyze bottlenecks in state-of-the-art vision and natural language processing (NLP) models, including EfficientNet and BERT, and use FAST to design accelerators capable of addressing these bottlenecks. FAST-generated accelerators optimized for single workloads improve Perf/TDP by 3.7× on average across all benchmarks compared to TPU-v3. A FAST-generated accelerator optimized for serving a suite of workloads improves Perf/TDP by 2.4× on average compared to TPU-v3. Our return on investment analysis shows that FAST-generated accelerators can potentially be practical for moderate-sized datacenter deployments.},
