## Overview

The increasing demand for machine learning workloads imposes intensive computational challenges that exceed the capabilities of traditional computer architectures. These workloads are not only computationally demanding but also require careful optimization for both performance efficiency and energy efficiency. General-purpose processors, designed for sequential computation, cannot efficiently handle the parallel matrix operations and data movement patterns of modern AI models. This fundamental mismatch drives the development of specialized hardware accelerators that optimize silicon resources through novel processing elements, memory hierarchies, and interconnect designs, aiming to balance both high performance and sustainable power consumption.

Hardware acceleration for AI encompasses multiple architectural approaches, each founded on a core set of design principles. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) employ thousands of parallel compute cores that achieve up to 100x speedup for data-parallel operations compared to CPUs. Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) implement systolic arrays that are specifically designed for efficient matrix multiplication. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide reconfigurable logic circuits for workload-specific optimizations. Understanding these fundamental design principles, along with their inherent trade-offs in performance, power efficiency, and programmability, enables system designers to develop effective acceleration strategies for AI workloads.

The evolution of AI accelerators reflects fundamental shifts in computer architecture. Traditional von Neumann designs separate processing and memory, creating data movement bottlenecks for AI computation. For example, moving data between DRAM and processing elements can consume 100-1000x more energy than the actual computation. Modern accelerators reshape this paradigm through processing-in-memory, near-memory computing, and novel dataflow architectures. These approaches minimize data movement costs while maximizing computational throughput for machine learning operations. The co-design of hardware and software enables further optimization through specialized instruction sets and compiler techniques.

This chapter examines hardware acceleration strategies for AI workloads, focusing on architectural approaches that enhance performance across training and inference. While the primary emphasis is on hardware design principles, we also explore the critical interplay between algorithmic requirements, compiler optimization, and hardware capabilities that determines real-world acceleration effectiveness.

## Hardware Evolution

The advancement of computing systems reveals a fundamental pattern in computer architecture: the progression from general-purpose processing to specialized hardware acceleration. This evolutionary path demonstrates how computational requirements drive architectural innovation through cycles of specialization and integration. When general-purpose processors encounter performance limitations for specific computational patterns, hardware specialization emerges as a systematic solution.

Specialized hardware acceleration represents the targeted optimization of frequently executed computational patterns through dedicated circuit implementations. This architectural approach introduces fundamental trade-offs between computational efficiency, silicon area utilization, and programming complexity. The development cycle typically progresses through distinct phases: identification of computational bottlenecks, implementation of specialized circuits, optimization of hardware-software interfaces, and eventual integration of proven specialized functions into mainstream processors.

The historical progression of hardware specialization provides essential insights into the underlying principles that guide modern accelerator architectures. These principles establish a framework for analyzing current trends in domain-specific computing and evaluating emerging approaches to hardware acceleration across diverse application domains.

### Specialized Computing

The trend toward specialized computing architectures emerges from fundamental limitations in general-purpose processing. Early computer systems relied on central processing units (CPUs) to handle all computational tasks through sequential instruction execution. However, certain computational patterns, particularly floating-point arithmetic, emerged as significant performance bottlenecks that demanded architectural innovation.

The introduction of the Intel 8087 mathematics coprocessor in 1980 marked a pivotal moment in hardware specialization. This dedicated floating-point unit (FPU) demonstrated how specialized circuits could dramatically accelerate specific computational patterns. The 8087 achieved performance improvements of up to 100x for floating-point operations compared to software implementations on the main processor. This performance gain established a critical principle: hardware specialization provides substantial benefits for well-defined, computationally intensive operations.

The success of FPU coprocessors led to their eventual integration into mainstream processors, establishing a pattern that would repeat throughout computer architecture evolution. The Intel 486DX in 1989 integrated floating-point capabilities directly into the CPU, improving system efficiency while maintaining specialized circuitry for floating-point computation. This integration pattern demonstrates how successful specialized functions eventually become standard features of general-purpose processors.

The principles established through early floating-point acceleration continue to influence modern hardware specialization. These include:

1. Identification of computational bottlenecks through workload analysis
2. Development of specialized circuits for frequent operations
3. Creation of efficient hardware-software interfaces
4. Progressive integration of proven specialized functions

This period in hardware specialization set the stage for increasingly sophisticated forms of acceleration. As computational demands grew more diverse and intensive, these basic principles extended to new domains including graphics processing, digital signal processing, and eventually, machine learning acceleration.

### Expanding Specialized Computing

The principles established through floating-point acceleration provided a blueprint for addressing emerging computational challenges. As computing applications diversified, new computational patterns emerged that exceeded the capabilities of general-purpose processors. This expansion of specialized computing manifested across multiple domains, each contributing unique insights to hardware acceleration strategies.

Graphics processing emerged as a significant driver of hardware specialization in the 1990s. Early graphics accelerators focused on specific operations like bitmap transfers and polygon filling. The introduction of programmable graphics pipelines with NVIDIA's GeForce 256 in 1999 represented a crucial advancement in specialized computing. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) demonstrated how parallel processing architectures could efficiently handle data-parallel workloads, achieving orders of magnitude improvement over CPU implementations for graphics operations.

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) represents another fundamental domain of hardware specialization. DSP processors introduced architectural innovations specifically designed for efficient signal processing operations. These included specialized multiply-accumulate units, circular buffers, and parallel data paths optimized for filtering and transform operations. Texas Instruments' TMS32010, introduced in 1983, established how domain-specific instruction sets and memory architectures could dramatically improve performance for signal processing applications.

Network processing introduced additional patterns of specialization. Network processors developed unique architectures to handle packet processing at line rate, incorporating multiple processing cores, specialized packet manipulation units, and sophisticated memory management systems. Intel's IXP2800 network processor demonstrated how multiple levels of hardware specialization could be combined to address complex processing requirements.

These diverse domains of specialization shared several common themes:

1. Identification of domain-specific computational patterns
2. Development of specialized processing elements and memory hierarchies
3. Creation of domain-specific programming models
4. Progressive evolution toward more flexible architectures

This period of expanding specialization demonstrated that hardware acceleration strategies could successfully address diverse computational requirements. The lessons learned from these domains would prove crucial for the development of modern accelerators, particularly in the emerging field of machine learning computation.

### Domain-Specific Architectures 

The emergence of domain-specific architectures (DSA) represents a fundamental shift in computer system design, driven by two critical factors: the ending of traditional scaling laws and the increasing computational demands of specialized workloads. The slowdown of Moore's Law and the end of Dennard scaling created a performance and efficiency crisis in general-purpose computing. As John Hennessy and David Patterson noted in their 2017 Turing Lecture, these limitations herald a new golden age of computer architecture focused on domain-specific solutions.

Traditional processor performance scaling relied on semiconductor process improvements and increased clock frequencies. However, power density limitations prevented continued frequency scaling, while manufacturing complexity slowed the pace of transistor density improvements. These constraints forced architects to reconsider fundamental design approaches. The solution emerged through specialized architectures that optimize silicon resources for specific computational domains, trading generality for efficiency.

Domain-specific architectures achieve superior performance and energy efficiency through several key principles:

1. Customized datapaths that match the computational patterns of target applications
2. Specialized memory hierarchies optimized for domain-specific data access patterns
3. Reduced instruction overhead through domain-specific instruction sets
4. Hardware structures that directly implement frequently used operations

One of the most successful deployments of domain-specific architectures can be found in multimedia processing. Modern smartphones, introduced in the late 2000s, can play high-definition video for extended durationsâpotentially over 20 hoursâwhile consuming minimal battery power, despite the computational complexity of video decoding. This remarkable efficiency stems from dedicated hardware video codecs implementing standards like H.264/AVC (introduced in 2003) and H.265/HEVC (finalized in 2013). These specialized circuits achieve orders of magnitude better performance and energy efficiency compared to software implementations on general-purpose processors. Similar specialization exists for audio processing, where dedicated hardware decoders handle formats like AAC (standardized in 1997) and MP3 (introduced in the early 1990s) with exceptional efficiency.

The success of these early domain-specific accelerators encouraged broader adoption of specialized computing approaches. Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), introduced in 2016, demonstrated how domain-specific architectures could achieve dramatic improvements in performance and energy efficiency for machine learning workloads. The TPU's systolic array architecture, optimized for matrix multiplication operations, exemplifies how understanding domain-specific computational patterns enables targeted architectural optimization.

This trend toward specialization continues to accelerate, with new architectures emerging for domains ranging from genomics processing to blockchain computation. The diversity of these solutions demonstrates that domain-specific architecture design has become a primary approach for addressing modern computational challenges. This shift represents not just a temporary trend but a fundamental change in how computing systems will be designed and optimized in the future.

### ML as a Computational Domain

Machine learning workloads present distinctive computational patterns that align naturally with domain-specific acceleration strategies. The core operations in machine learning, particularly deep neural networks, exhibit high computational intensity with structured parallelism. These characteristics make machine learning an ideal candidate for specialized hardware implementations that can exploit these patterns for improved performance and energy efficiency.

The computational requirements of machine learning workloads vary significantly between training and inference phases. During training, the hardware must handle both forward and backward propagation, requiring additional memory for storing intermediate activations and gradients. This process demands higher precision arithmetic to ensure stable gradient updates and convergence. In contrast, inference focuses solely on forward propagation and can often operate with reduced precision, enabling different optimization strategies.

The foundational operations remain similar across both phases - dominated by dense matrix multiplication operations that form the backbone of neural network computation. This computational intensity couples with substantial memory bandwidth demands, as large volumes of weight parameters and activation data must be efficiently moved between storage and processing elements. Training particularly stresses these requirements, needing to maintain multiple batches of data and their corresponding gradients in memory.

A distinctive aspect of machine learning computation is the varying precision requirements between training and inference. While training typically demands higher precision (often FP32 or FP16) to maintain gradient fidelity, inference can often operate with dramatically reduced precision (INT8 or even lower) while maintaining acceptable accuracy. This precision flexibility has led to specialized hardware designs that can dynamically adapt their arithmetic units between training and inference modes.

These patterns have driven the development of diverse acceleration approaches. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) extended their parallel processing capabilities to machine learning computation through specialized tensor cores and enhanced memory hierarchies. Modern GPUs often include dedicated hardware for both training and inference, with features like mixed-precision arithmetic and specialized memory management for gradient accumulation. The transition was natural - the same architectural features that made GPUs efficient for graphics rendering proved valuable for neural network computation.

Google's Tensor Processing Unit demonstrates a more targeted approach to machine learning acceleration. While early TPU versions focused primarily on inference workloads, later generations expanded to support training through architectural adaptations like higher precision units and more sophisticated memory hierarchies. By focusing specifically on neural network computation, the TPU achieves higher efficiency than more general-purpose accelerators. Its systolic array architecture directly implements the matrix multiplication patterns central to neural network processing, demonstrating how understanding domain-specific requirements enables focused optimization.

The success of machine learning accelerators validates the broader principles of domain-specific architecture design. Just as video codecs made multimedia processing practical on mobile devices, specialized ML accelerators are making neural network inference feasible on edge devices, while training accelerators enable faster model development in data centers. This parallel highlights how domain-specific architectures can transform the practical applications of computationally intensive algorithms across different deployment scenarios.

### Application-specific Specialization

The evolution of specialized hardware architectures demonstrates a fundamental principle in computer systems: as computational patterns emerge and mature, hardware specialization follows to achieve optimal performance and energy efficiency. @tbl-hw-evolution illustrates this progression across different computing eras, showing how specific computational needs consistently drive architectural innovation. While not comprehensive, the table highlights a clear pattern---specialized hardware solutions emerge to address the dominant computational requirements of each period, optimizing for both performance and energy efficiency.

: Evolution of hardware specialization across computing eras. {#tbl-hw-evolution .striped .hover}

This historical progression reveals that hardware specialization is not a recent phenomenon but rather a consistent approach to achieving computational efficiency. As new computational patterns become important enough to justify dedicated hardware, specialized architectures emerge to optimize their execution. The success of these specialized solutions depends on fundamental principles of computer architecture: matching hardware structures to computational patterns, optimizing memory hierarchies for specific access patterns, and balancing specialization with programmability. Understanding these principles of hardware specialization is needed for developing efficient machine learning systems. The next sections explore how these principles manifest in modern AI accelerators, examining the architectural approaches that enable efficient execution of machine learning workloads.

## Processor Architecture Primitives for ML

Machine learning computations follow predictable patterns that emerge from the mathematical foundations of neural networks. These patterns, which we examined earlier when studying neural network architectures, determine which operations processors must execute efficiently. By examining how high-level ML code transforms into actual computation, we can understand why specific primitives become essential components of processor architecture.

When an ML developer writes a dense layer, the high-level abstraction undergoes multiple translations before execution:

```python
# High-level framework code
dense = Dense(512)(input_tensor)
```

This abstraction translates into basic mathematical operations:

```python
# Mathematical operations
output = matmul(input_weights) + bias
output = activation(output)
```

The mathematical representation then decomposes into the actual computation executed by processors:

```python
# Computational implementation
for n in range(batch_size):
    for m in range(output_size):
        sum = bias[m]
        for k in range(input_size):
            sum += input[n,k] * weights[k,m]
        output[n,m] = activation(sum)
```

This decomposition reveals several fundamental computational characteristics. Matrix multiplication operations decompose into systematic sequences of multiply-accumulate operations that form the core computational pattern. The batch dimension naturally creates opportunities for vector-level parallelism across multiple data elements. Memory access patterns exhibit regular striding behaviors when accessing both input data and weight parameters. Finally, activation functions require efficient element-wise operations that must be applied across large arrays of numerical data

Hardware designers analyze these computational patterns to determine which operations warrant dedicated hardware support. Three factors guide this decision. First, the operation must appear frequently enough in ML workloads to justify the silicon area cost. Second, it should provide significant performance or energy efficiency improvements compared to implementation using more basic operations. Third, the primitive should remain useful across multiple generations of ML models and architectures.

The following sections examine four categories of processor primitives that have emerged from this analysis: vector operations, matrix operations, dataflow patterns, and special function units. Each category addresses specific computational requirements of neural networks, providing building blocks for efficient ML processing.

### Vector Operations

Modern machine learning frameworks abstract neural network computations into high-level operations, concealing the underlying execution complexity from developers. Understanding how these abstractions translate to hardware execution reveals the fundamental importance of vector operations in machine learning acceleration.

Consider a typical neural network layer implementation in a modern framework:

```python
# Framework Level: What ML developers write
layer = nn.Linear(256, 512)  # Layer transforms 256 inputs to 512 outputs
output = layer(input_tensor) # Process a batch of inputs
```

This simple expression represents a fully connected layer that transforms input features into output values through learned weights. The framework translates this high-level abstraction into mathematical operations that more closely represent the actual computation:

```python
# Framework Internal: How the operation decomposes
Z = matmul(weights, input) + bias    # Each output needs all inputs
output = activation(Z)               # Transform each result
```

When executing on processors, these mathematical operations decompose into explicit computational steps. Each output value requires a sequence of multiply-accumulate operations across all input features:

```python
# Computational Level: Actual execution pattern
for batch in range(32):              # Process 32 samples at once
    for out_neuron in range(512):    # Compute each output neuron
        sum = 0.0
        for in_feature in range(256): # Each output needs all inputs
            sum += input[batch, in_feature] * weights[out_neuron, in_feature]
        output[batch, out_neuron] = activation(sum + bias[out_neuron])
```

Traditional scalar processors execute these operations one at a time, fetching and processing individual values sequentially. For a single batch of 32 samples, computing the layer outputs requires over 4 million multiply-accumulate operations. Each operation involves loading an input value, loading a weight value, multiplying them together, and adding to a running sum. This sequential processing creates substantial inefficiency when executing the massive number of identical operations required by neural networks.

Vector processing units transform this execution pattern by operating on multiple data elements simultaneously. The following RISC-V assembly code demonstrates how modern vector processors handle these computations:

```assembly
# Vector hardware execution (RISC-V Vector Extension)
vsetvli t0, a0, e32   # Process 8 elements at once
loop_batch:
    loop_neuron:
        vxor.vv v0, v0, v0    # Clear 8 accumulators
        loop_feature:
            vle32.v v1, (in_ptr)   # Load 8 inputs together
            vle32.v v2, (wt_ptr)   # Load 8 weights together
            vfmacc.vv v0, v1, v2   # 8 multiply-adds at once
            add in_ptr, in_ptr, 32  # Move to next 8 inputs
            add wt_ptr, wt_ptr, 32  # Move to next 8 weights
            bnez feature_cnt, loop_feature
```

This vector implementation processes eight data elements in parallel, reducing both computation time and energy consumption. Vector load instructions transfer eight values in a single operation, maximizing memory bandwidth utilization. The vector multiply-accumulate instruction processes eight pairs of values simultaneously, dramatically reducing the total number of required instructions. For the example layer, this vector processing reduces the total instruction count from over 4 million to approximately 500,000.

Beyond the basic vector operations discussed above, modern vector processors support additional specialized operations that accelerate common neural network patterns. These operations map directly to computational patterns found in modern neural architectures, allowing frameworks to efficiently execute complex models. @tbl-vector-ops below highlights some key vector operations and their relevance to neural network computations:

| Vector Operation | Description | Neural Network Application |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Reduction | Combines elements across a vector (e.g., sum, max) | Pooling layers, attention score computation |
| Gather | Loads multiple non-consecutive memory elements | Embedding lookups, sparse operations |
| Scatter | Writes to multiple non-consecutive memory locations | Gradient updates for embeddings |
| Masked operations | Selectively operates on vector elements | Attention masks, padding handling |
| Vector-scalar broadcast | Applies scalar to all vector elements | Bias addition, scaling operations |

: Vector operations. {#tbl-vector-ops}

The efficiency gains from vector processing extend beyond raw instruction count reduction. Memory bandwidth utilization improves as vector loads transfer multiple values per operation. Energy efficiency increases because control logic is shared across multiple operations. These improvements compound across the deep layers of modern neural networks, where billions of operations execute for each forward pass.

Vector operations form the foundation for higher-level architectural primitives in machine learning accelerators. Matrix operations build upon vector capabilities to process entire layers efficiently. Dataflow patterns optimize how vector operations chain together across neural network layers. Special function units accelerate specific vector computations common in neural networks. The following sections examine these architectural primitives in detail, revealing how they combine to create efficient machine learning acceleration systems.

### Matrix Operations

Neural network computations fundamentally operate on matrices of weights, activations, and gradients. While vector operations provide element-wise processing capabilities, matrix operations handle the core layer transformations where multiple inputs influence multiple outputs simultaneously. Understanding this relationship reveals key principles in neural network acceleration.

Consider the computation of a neural network layer:

```python
# Framework Level: What ML developers write
layer = nn.Linear(256, 512)  # Layer transforms 256 inputs to 512 outputs
output = layer(input_batch)  # Process a batch of 32 samples

# Framework Internal: Core operations
Z = matmul(weights, input)   # Matrix: transforms [256 x 32] input to [512 x 32] output
Z = Z + bias                 # Vector: adds bias to each output independently
output = relu(Z)             # Vector: applies activation to each element independently
```

In this example, each output neuron (512 of them) needs to consider all input features (256 of them) for each sample in the batch (32 samples). The weight matrix contains 256 Ã 512 = 131,072 parameters that define these connections. Matrix multiplication efficiently handles this massive parallel computation.

This pattern appears throughout modern neural architectures. The examples illustrate how diverse neural network operations reduce to matrix multiplications. Linear layers directly map to matrix operations, with weights transforming input features to output features. In attention mechanisms, multiple matrix multiplications enable the network to learn which parts of the input to focus on - first projecting inputs into different spaces (queries and keys), then comparing all positions with each other. Even convolutions, which initially appear quite different, can be reformulated as matrix operations by rearranging image patches into columns. 

```python
# Linear Layers - Direct matrix multiply
hidden = matmul(weights, inputs)    # weights: [out_dim x in_dim], inputs: [in_dim x batch]
                                    # Result combines all inputs for each output

# Attention Mechanisms - Multiple matrix operations
Q = matmul(Wq, inputs)       # Project inputs to query space [query_dim x batch]
K = matmul(Wk, inputs)       # Project inputs to key space [key_dim x batch]
attention = matmul(Q, K.T)   # Compare all queries with all keys [query_dim x key_dim]
                             # Each output influenced by all positions

# Convolutions - Matrix multiply after reshaping
patches = im2col(input)           # Convert [H x W x C] image to matrix of patches
                                  # Each column represents one spatial location
output = matmul(kernel, patches)  # Apply kernels to all patches simultaneously
```

This pervasive pattern of matrix multiplication across neural network operations has direct implications for hardware design. Efficient matrix multiplication units can accelerate most neural network computations since each operation transforms multiple inputs to multiple outputs simultaneously. Modern processors implement matrix units that extend beyond simple vector processing - while vector units handle parallel independent operations, matrix units coordinate computation across multiple dimensions:

```assembly
# Matrix processing unit operation for a block of the computation
mload mr1, (weight_ptr)     # Load e.g., 16x16 block of weight matrix 
mload mr2, (input_ptr)      # Load corresponding input block
matmul.mm mr3, mr1, mr2     # Multiply and accumulate entire blocks at once
mstore (output_ptr), mr3    # Store computed output block
```

The interplay between vector and matrix operations continues throughout neural network execution. Matrix operations handle the layer transformationsâfully connected layers, convolution operations, and attention mechanismsâwhere many inputs affect many outputs. Vector operations manage the element-wise computationsâactivation functions, normalization, and gradient updatesâwhere each output depends only on its corresponding input. Understanding this complementary relationship helps explain the architectural choices in modern ML accelerators.

The complementary nature of vector and matrix operations suggests when each is most appropriate:

| Operation Type | Best For | Examples | Key Characteristic |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Matrix Operations | Many-to-many transforms | â¢ Layer transformations<br>â¢ Attention computation<br>â¢ Convolutions | Each output depends on multiple inputs |
| Vector Operations | One-to-one transforms | â¢ Activation functions<br>â¢ Layer normalization<br>â¢ Element-wise gradients | Each output depends only on corresponding input |

This breakdown helps hardware designers optimize for both patterns, providing dedicated matrix units for the intensive many-to-many computations while maintaining efficient vector units for the numerous element-wise operations that connect them. 

### Dataflow Patterns

While vector and matrix operations define the core computations in neural networks, dataflow patterns determine how these operations are orchestrated across hardware resources. The execution of neural networks involves not just performing operations, but moving the right data to the right place at the right time. The efficiency of this movement often determines the overall performance of ML accelerators.

Consider our matrix multiplication from earlier where each output requires data from both weight and input matrices:
```python
# Matrix multiplication Z = weights @ input where:
# weights: [512 x 256] - model parameters
# input:   [256 x 32]  - batch of activations
# Z:       [512 x 32]  - output activations

# Each output element Z[i,j] needs:
for i in range(512):
    for j in range(32):
        # Need entire row of weights[i,:]
        # Need entire column of input[:,j]
        for k in range(256):
            Z[i,j] += weights[i,k] * input[k,j]
```

This computation reveals key dataflow challenges. Each output element requires access to a full row of weights and a full column of input values. With millions of parameters and thousands of activations, moving this data efficiently becomes critical. The weight matrix might be reused across multiple batches of inputs. Input values contribute to multiple outputs. Partial products must be accumulated over many multiply-add operations.

Different dataflow patterns represent different strategies for orchestrating these movements. Each pattern makes different tradeoffs in:

- Data reuse: How many times can we use data once we load it?
- Storage hierarchy: Where do we keep different types of data?
- Parallelism: How do we distribute computation across hardware?
- Energy efficiency: How can we minimize costly data movement?

The key dataflow primitives in ML accelerators center around three basic patterns of data movement:

The key dataflow primitives in ML accelerators center around three basic patterns of data movement:

#### Weight Stationary

This primitive keeps weight parameters fixed in local storage while streaming different input activations through the computation units:
```python
# Weight stationary pattern
for weight_block in weights:
    load_to_local(weight_block)     # Load weights once
    for input_block in inputs:
        compute(weight_block, input_block)  # Reuse weights many times
```

#### Output Stationary

This primitive accumulates partial sums for each output in place while bringing in required weights and inputs:

```python
# Output stationary pattern
for output_element in outputs:
    accumulator = 0
    for w, x in zip(weights, inputs):
        accumulator += w * x        # Build up each output in place
    store_output(accumulator)
```

#### Input Stationary

This primitive holds input activations stable while cycling through corresponding weights:

```python
# Input stationary pattern
for input_block in inputs:
    load_to_local(input_block)      # Load inputs once
    for weight_block in weights:
        compute(weight_block, input_block)  # Reuse inputs many times
```

These primitives represent fundamental choices in how to move data through the hardware. Each offers different tradeoffs in data reuse and energy efficiency. More complex dataflow patterns build upon these basic primitives by combining them in various ways across different levels of the memory hierarchy.
