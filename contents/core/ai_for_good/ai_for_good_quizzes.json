It primarily provides context and motivation for the chapter's focus on deploying ML systems in resource-constrained environments for social impact. The section does not introduce specific technical tradeoffs, system components, or operational implications that require active understanding or application by students. Instead, it outlines the thematic focus and scope of the chapter without delving into actionable concepts or design decisions. As such, a self-check quiz is not warranted at this stage, as the section is more descriptive and motivational, lacking the depth needed for pedagogically valuable self-check questions."
