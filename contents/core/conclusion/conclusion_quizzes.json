It does not introduce new concepts, technical tradeoffs, system components, or operational implications that require active understanding or application. The section serves as a farewell and encouragement from the author, Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi, and does not present actionable concepts or require reinforcement of previous knowledge. Therefore, a quiz is not pedagogically valuable for this section."
