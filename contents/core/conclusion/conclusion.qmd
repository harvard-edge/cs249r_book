## Introduction

This book examines the rapidly evolving field of ML systems (@sec-ml_systems). We focused on systems because while there are many resources on ML models and algorithms, more needs to be understood about how to build the systems that run them.

To draw an analogy, consider the process of building a car. While many resources are available on the various components of a car, such as the engine, transmission, and suspension, there is often a need for more understanding about how to assemble these components into a functional vehicle. Just as a car requires a well-designed and properly integrated system to operate efficiently and reliably, ML models also require a robust and carefully constructed system to deliver their full potential. Moreover, there is a lot of nuance in building ML systems, given their specific use case. For example, a Formula 1 race car must be assembled differently from an everyday Prius consumer car.

Our journey started by tracing ML's historical trajectory, from its theoretical foundations to its current state as a transformative force across industries (@sec-dl_primer). This journey has highlighted the remarkable progress in the field, challenges, and opportunities.

Throughout this book, we have looked into the intricacies of ML systems, examining the critical components and best practices necessary to create a seamless and efficient pipeline. From data preprocessing and model training to deployment and monitoring, we have provided insights and guidance to help readers navigate the complex landscape of ML system development.

ML systems involve complex workflows, spanning various topics from data engineering to model deployment on diverse systems (@sec-ai_workflow). By providing an overview of these ML system components, we have aimed to showcase the tremendous depth and breadth of the field and expertise that is needed. Understanding the intricacies of ML workflows is crucial for practitioners and researchers alike, as it enables them to navigate the landscape effectively and develop robust, efficient, and impactful ML solutions.

By focusing on the systems aspect of ML, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. Just as a healthy human body system allows the organs to function optimally, a well-designed ML system enables the models to consistently deliver accurate and reliable results. This book's goal is to empower readers with the knowledge and tools necessary to build ML systems that showcase the underlying models' power and ensure smooth integration and operation, much like a well-functioning human body.

## Knowing the Importance of ML Datasets

One of the key things we have emphasized is that data is the foundation upon which ML systems are built (@sec-data_engineering). Data is the new code that programs deep neural networks, making data engineering the first and most critical stage of any ML pipeline. That is why we began our exploration by diving into the basics of data engineering, recognizing that quality, diversity, and ethical sourcing are key to building robust and reliable machine learning models.

The importance of high-quality data must be balanced. Lapses in data quality can lead to significant negative consequences, such as flawed predictions, project terminations, and even potential harm to communities. These cascading effects, often called "Data Cascades," highlight the need for diligent data management and governance practices. ML practitioners must prioritize data quality, ensure diversity and representativeness, and adhere to ethical data collection and usage standards. By doing so, we can mitigate the risks associated with poor data quality and build ML systems that are trustworthy, reliable, and beneficial to society.

## Navigating the AI Framework Landscape

There are many different ML frameworks. Therefore, we dove into the evolution of different ML frameworks, dissecting the inner workings of popular ones like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and provided insights into the core components and advanced features that define them (@sec-ai_frameworks). We also looked into the specialization of frameworks tailored to specific needs, such as those designed for embedded AI. We discussed the criteria for selecting the most suitable framework for a given project.

Our exploration also touched upon the future trends expected to shape the landscape of ML frameworks in the coming years. As the field continues to evolve, we can anticipate the emergence of more specialized and optimized frameworks that cater to the unique requirements of different domains and deployment scenarios, as we saw with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers. By staying abreast of these developments and understanding the tradeoffs involved in framework selection, we can make informed decisions and leverage the most appropriate tools to build efficient ML systems.

Moreover, we expect to see a growing emphasis on framework interoperability and standardization efforts, such as the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format. This format allows models to be trained in one framework and deployed in another, facilitating greater collaboration and portability across different platforms and environments.

## Understanding ML Training Fundamentals

As ML practitioners who build ML systems, it is crucial to deeply understand the AI training process and the system challenges in scaling and optimizing it. By leveraging the capabilities of modern AI frameworks and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in training techniques, we can build robust, efficient, and scalable ML systems that can tackle real-world problems and drive innovation across various domains.

We began by examining the fundamentals of AI training (@sec-ai_training), which involves feeding data into ML models and adjusting their parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs. This process is computationally intensive and requires careful consideration of various factors, such as the choice of optimization algorithms, learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing effective and efficient training pipelines.

However, training ML models at scale poses significant system challenges. As datasets' size and models' complexity grow, the computational resources required for training can become prohibitively expensive. This has led to the development of distributed training techniques, such as data and model parallelism, which allow multiple devices to collaborate in the training process. Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch have evolved to support these distributed training paradigms, enabling practitioners to scale their training workloads across clusters of GPUs or TPUs.

In addition to distributed training, we discussed techniques for optimizing the training process, such as mixed-precision training and gradient compression. It's important to note that while these techniques may seem algorithmic, they significantly impact system performance. The choice of training algorithms, precision, and communication strategies directly affects the ML system's resource utilization, scalability, and efficiency. Therefore, adopting an algorithm-hardware or algorithm-system co-design approach is crucial, where the algorithmic choices are made in tandem with the system considerations. By understanding the interplay between algorithms and hardware, we can make informed decisions that optimize the model performance and the system efficiency, ultimately leading to more effective and scalable ML solutions.

## Pursuing Efficiency in AI Systems

Deploying trained ML models is more complex than simply running the networks; efficiency is critical (@sec-efficient_ai).

In addition to the advancements in ML hardware, we also explored on-device learning, where models can adapt and learn directly on the device (@sec-ondevice_learning). This approach has significant implications for data privacy and security, as sensitive information can be processed locally without the need for transmission to external servers.

On-device learning enhances privacy by keeping data within the confines of the device, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. It also reduces reliance on cloud connectivity, enabling ML models to function effectively even in scenarios with limited or intermittent internet access. We have discussed techniques such as transfer learning and federated learning, which have expanded the capabilities of on-device learning. Transfer learning allows models to leverage knowledge gained from one task or domain to improve performance on another, enabling more efficient and effective learning on resource-constrained devices. On the other hand, Federated learning enables collaborative model updates across distributed devices without centralized data aggregation. This approach allows multiple devices to contribute to learning while keeping their data locally, enhancing privacy and security.

These advancements in on-device learning have paved the way for more secure, privacy-preserving, and decentralized machine learning applications. As we prioritize data privacy and security in developing ML systems, we expect to see more innovative solutions that enable powerful AI capabilities while protecting sensitive information and ensuring user privacy.

## Streamlining ML Operations

Even if we got the above pieces right, challenges and considerations must be addressed to ensure ML models' successful integration and operation in production environments. In the MLOps chapter (@sec-mlops), we studied the practices and architectures necessary to develop, deploy, and manage ML models throughout their entire lifecycle. We looked at the phases of ML, from data collection and model training to evaluation, deployment, and ongoing monitoring.

We learned about the importance of automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement in MLOps.

No ML system is ever complete without thinking about security and privacy. They are of major importance when developing real-world ML systems. As machine learning finds increasing application in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and personal data, safeguarding confidentiality and preventing the misuse of data and models becomes a critical imperative, and these were the concepts we discussed previously (@sec-security_privacy).

To build robust and responsible ML systems, practitioners must thoroughly understand the potential security and privacy risks. These risks include data leaks, which can expose sensitive information; model theft, where malicious actors steal trained models; adversarial attacks that can manipulate model behavior; bias in models that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes; and unintended access to private information.

Mitigating these risks requires a deep understanding of best practices in security and privacy. Therefore, we have emphasized that security and privacy cannot be an afterthought---they must be proactively addressed at every stage of the ML system development lifecycle. From the initial stages of data collection and labeling, it is crucial to ensure that data is handled securely and that privacy is protected. During model training and evaluation, techniques such as differential privacy and secure multi-party computation can be employed to safeguard sensitive information.

When deploying ML models, robust access controls, encryption, and monitoring mechanisms must be implemented to prevent unauthorized access and detect potential security breaches. Ongoing monitoring and auditing of ML systems as part of MLOps are also essential to identify and address emerging security or privacy vulnerabilities.

By embedding security and privacy considerations into each stage of building, deploying, and managing ML systems, we can safely unlock the benefits of AI while protecting individuals' rights and ensuring the responsible use of these powerful technologies. Only through this proactive and comprehensive approach can we build ML systems that are not only technologically advanced but also ethically sound and worthy of public trust.
