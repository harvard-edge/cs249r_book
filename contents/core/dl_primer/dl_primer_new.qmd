This chapter is a primer on deep learning from a systems perspective, providing us with essential context and the foundational knowledge that is needed to implement and optimize deep learning solutions effectively. ML systems represents the bridge between theoretical machine learning concepts and their practical implementation in real-world computing systems. Our goal is to help readers understand how theoretical constructs translate into computational requirements, resource constraints, and system design decisions.

We begin with an overview of deep learning's evolution and its significance in modern computing systems, from edge devices to data centers. We introduce the core concepts like neural networks with a dual focus: first understanding their theoretical foundations, then examining their practical implications for system implementation.

## Overview

Deep learning, a specialized area within machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), utilizes algorithms modeled after the structure and function of neural networks to process and learn from large amounts of data. From a systems perspective, deep learning represents a unique intersection of algorithms, hardware, and software infrastructure working together to solve complex computational problems.

When implementing deep learning in real-world systems, we need to consider it as part of a broader computing stack. @fig-ai-ml-dl provides a visual representation of how deep learning fits within the broader context of AI and machine learning. As shown in the figure, AI represents the overarching field, encompassing all computational methods that mimic human cognitive functions. Machine learning, shown as a subset of AI, includes algorithms capable of learning from data. Deep learning, the smallest subset in the diagram, specifically involves neural networks that are able to learn more complex patterns from large volumes of data.

This progression from AI to deep learning represents key shifts across three fundamental dimensions:

1. **Data**: From structured, rule-based knowledge to massive datasets of raw, unstructured information. Deep learning's ability to learn from raw data eliminates the need for manual feature engineering but demands substantially larger datasets.

2. **Algorithms**: From explicit programming to learned patterns. While traditional AI relies on handcrafted rules and machine learning uses statistical methods, deep learning algorithms automatically discover hierarchical representations in data through multiple layers of abstraction.

3. **Computation**: From basic arithmetic operations to massive parallel processing. The computational demands grow significantly as we move from simple AI algorithms to complex deep neural networks, driving innovations in specialized hardware and distributed computing.

This evolution has profound implications for how we build and deploy AI systems. Deep learning's appetite for data and computation has spurred developments in specialized hardware like GPUs and TPUs, scalable software frameworks, and efficient data pipelines. Understanding these relationships is important for effectively implementing deep learning solutions across different computing environments, from powerful data centers to resource-constrained edge devices. To build this understanding, we must start with the fundamentals. In the following sections, we first examine the historical development and computational growth of deep learning systems. We then explore core neural network concepts, focusing on how theoretical principles translate into practical implementations. This foundation will enable us to better understand modern architectures, their computational patterns, and ultimately, how to build ML systems.

## Understanding Deep Learning

### What Makes Deep Learning Different

Deep learning represents a fundamental shift in how we approach problem solving with computers. To understand this shift, let's consider the classic example of computer vision---specifically, the task of identifying objects in images. 

#### Traditional Programming: The Era of Explicit Rules

Traditional programming requires developers to explicitly define rules that tell computers how to process inputs and produce outputs. Consider a simple game like Breakout, shown in @fig-breakout. The program needs explicit rules for every interaction: when the ball hits a brick, the code must specify that the brick should be removed and the ball's direction should be reversed. While this approach works well for games with clear physics and limited states, it demonstrates an inherent limitation of rule-based systems.

![Rule-based programming.](images/png/breakout.png){#fig-breakout}

This rules-based paradigm extends to all traditional programming, as illustrated in @fig-traditional. The program takes both rules for processing and input data to produce outputs. Early artificial intelligence research explored whether this approach could scale to solve complex problems by encoding sufficient rules to capture intelligent behavior.

![Traditional programming.](images/png/traditional.png){#fig-traditional}

However, the limitations of rule-based approaches become evident when addressing complex real-world tasks. Consider the problem of recognizing human activities, shown in @fig-activity-rules. Initial rules might appear straightforward: classify movement below 4 mph as walking and faster movement as running. Yet real-world complexity quickly emerges. The classification must account for variations in speed, transitions between activities, and numerous edge cases. Each new consideration requires additional rules, leading to increasingly complex decision trees.

![Activity rules.](images/png/activities.png){#fig-activity-rules}

This challenge extends to computer vision tasks. Detecting objects like cats in images would require rules about characteristic features: pointed ears, whiskers, typical body shapes. Such rules would need to account for variations in viewing angle, lighting conditions, partial occlusions, and natural variations among instances. Early computer vision systems attempted this approach through geometric rules but achieved success only in controlled environments with well-defined objects.

This knowledge engineering approach characterized artificial intelligence research in the 1970s and 1980s. Expert systems encoded domain knowledge as explicit rules, showing promise in specific domains with well-defined parameters but struggling with tasks humans perform naturally---such as object recognition, speech understanding, or natural language interpretation. These limitations highlighted a fundamental challenge: many aspects of intelligent behavior rely on implicit knowledge that resists explicit rule-based representation.

#### Machine Learning: Learning from Engineered Patterns

The limitations of pure rule-based systems led researchers to explore approaches that could learn from data. Machine learning offered a promising direction: instead of writing rules for every situation, we could write programs that found patterns in examples. However, the success of these methods still depended heavily on human insight to define what patterns might be important---a process known as feature engineering.

Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into representations that make patterns more apparent to learning algorithms. In computer vision, researchers developed sophisticated methods to extract meaningful patterns from images. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method, shown in @fig-hog, exemplifies this approach. HOG works by first identifying edges in an image---places where brightness changes sharply, often indicating object boundaries. It then divides the image into small cells and measures how edges are oriented within each cell, summarizing these orientations in a histogram. This transformation converts raw pixel values into a representation that captures important shape information while being robust to variations in lighting and small changes in position.

![Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) requires explicit feature engineering.](images/png/hog.png){#fig-hog}

Other feature extraction methods like SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and Gabor filters provided different ways to capture patterns in images. SIFT found distinctive points that could be recognized even when an object's size or orientation changed. Gabor filters helped identify textures and repeated patterns. Each method encoded different types of human insight about what makes visual patterns recognizable.

These engineered features enabled significant advances in computer vision during the 2000s. Systems could now recognize objects with some robustness to real-world variations, leading to applications in face detection, pedestrian detection, and object recognition. However, the approach had fundamental limitations. Experts needed to carefully design feature extractors for each new problem, and the resulting features might miss important patterns that weren't anticipated in their design.

#### Deep Learning

Deep learning fundamentally differs by learning directly from raw data. Traditional programming, as we saw earlier in @fig-traditional, required both rules and data as inputs to produce answers. Machine learning inverts this relationship, as shown in @fig-deeplearning. Instead of writing rules, we provide examples (data) and their correct answers to discover the underlying rules automatically. This shift eliminates the need for humans to specify what patterns are important.

![Deep learning.](images/png/ml_rules.png){#fig-deeplearning}

The system discovers these patterns automatically from examples. When shown millions of images of cats, the system learns to identify increasingly complex visual patterns---from simple edges to more sophisticated combinations that make up cat-like features. This mirrors how our own visual system works, building up understanding from basic visual elements to complex objects.

Unlike traditional approaches where performance often plateaus with more data and computation, deep learning systems continue to improve as we provide more resources. More training examples help the system recognize more variations and nuances. More computational power enables the system to discover more subtle patterns. This scalability has led to dramatic improvements in performance---for example, the accuracy of image recognition systems has improved from 74% in 2012 to over 95% today.

This different approach has profound implications for how we build AI systems. Deep learning's ability to learn directly from raw data eliminates the need for manual feature engineering, but it comes with new demands. We need sophisticated infrastructure to handle massive datasets, powerful computers to process this data, and specialized hardware to perform the complex mathematical calculations efficiently. The computational requirements of deep learning have even driven the development of new types of computer chips optimized for these calculations.

The success of deep learning in computer vision exemplifies how this approach, when given sufficient data and computation, can surpass traditional methods. This pattern has repeated across many domains, from speech recognition to game playing, establishing deep learning as a transformative approach to artificial intelligence.

### From Brain to Artificial Neurons

The quest to create artificial intelligence has been profoundly influenced by our understanding of biological intelligence, particularly the human brain. This isn't surprising---the brain represents the most sophisticated information processing system we know of, capable of learning, adapting, and solving complex problems while maintaining remarkable energy efficiency. The way our brains function has provided fundamental insights that continue to shape how we approach artificial intelligence.

#### Bilogoical Intelligence

When we observe biological intelligence, several key principles emerge. The brain demonstrates an extraordinary ability to learn from experience, constantly modifying its neural connections based on new information and interactions with the environment. This adaptability is fundamental---every experience potentially alters the brain's structure, refining its responses for future situations. This biological capability directly inspired one of the core principles of machine learning: the ability to learn and improve from data rather than following fixed, pre-programmed rules.

Another striking feature of biological intelligence is its parallel processing capability. The brain processes vast amounts of information simultaneously, with different regions specializing in specific functions while working in concert. This distributed, parallel architecture stands in stark contrast to traditional sequential computing and has significantly influenced modern AI system design. The brain's ability to efficiently coordinate these parallel processes while maintaining coherent function represents a level of sophistication we're still working to fully understand and replicate.

The brain's pattern recognition capabilities are particularly noteworthy. Biological systems excel at identifying patterns in complex, noisy data---whether recognizing faces in a crowd, understanding speech in a noisy environment, or identifying objects from partial information. This remarkable ability has inspired numerous AI applications, particularly in computer vision and speech recognition systems. The brain accomplishes these tasks with an efficiency that artificial systems are still striving to match.

Perhaps most remarkably, biological systems achieve all this with incredible energy efficiency. The human brain operates on approximately 20 watts of power---about the same as a low-power light bulb---while performing complex cognitive tasks that would require orders of magnitude more power in current artificial systems. This efficiency hasn't just impressed researchers; it has become a crucial goal in the development of AI hardware and algorithms.

These biological principles have led to two distinct but complementary approaches in artificial intelligence. The first attempts to directly mimic neural structure and function, leading to artificial neural networks and deep learning architectures that structurally resemble biological neural networks. The second takes a more abstract approach, adapting biological principles to work efficiently within the constraints of computer hardware without necessarily copying biological structures exactly.

#### Aritificial Intelligence

The translation from biological principles to artificial computation requires a systematic understanding of what makes biological neural networks effective. The brain's computational architecture offers several fundamental insights that inform the design of artificial neural systems.

The brain processes information through distributed computation across billions of neurons, each operating relatively slowly compared to silicon transistors. A biological neuron fires at approximately 200Hz, while modern processors operate at gigahertz frequencies. Despite this speed limitation, the brain's parallel architecture enables sophisticated real-time processing of complex sensory input, decision making, and control of behavior.

This computational efficiency emerges from the brain's basic organizational principles. Each neuron acts as a simple processing unit, integrating inputs from thousands of other neurons and producing a binary output signal based on whether this integrated input exceeds a threshold. The connection strengths between neurons, mediated by synapses, are continuously modified through experience. This synaptic plasticity forms the basis for learning and adaptation in biological neural networks.

These biological principles suggest key computational elements needed in artificial neural systems:

- Simple processing units that integrate multiple inputs
- Adjustable connection strengths between units
- Nonlinear activation based on input thresholds
- Parallel processing architecture
- Learning through modification of connection strengths

These fundamental elements provide the blueprint for artificial neural networks. However, translating these biological principles into practical computational systems requires careful consideration of how to implement each element within the constraints and capabilities of digital hardware.

#### Computational Translation

The challenge in artificial neural networks becomes implementing these principles within the constraints of digital computing systems. This translation requires careful consideration of how to represent neural activity, connection strengths, and learning mechanisms in ways that can be efficiently computed while preserving the essential computational properties that make biological neural networks effective.

The implementation of biological principles in artificial neural systems represents a careful balance between biological fidelity and computational efficiency. At its core, an artificial neuron captures the essential computational properties of its biological counterpart through mathematical operations that can be efficiently executed on digital hardware.

The basic computational unit in artificial neural networks, the artificial neuron, simplifies the complex electrochemical processes of biological neurons into three fundamental operations. First, input signals are weighted, mimicking how biological synapses modulate incoming signals with different strengths. Second, these weighted inputs are summed together, analogous to how a biological neuron integrates incoming signals in its cell body. Finally, the summed input passes through an activation function that determines the neuron's output, similar to how a biological neuron fires based on whether its membrane potential exceeds a threshold.

This mathematical abstraction preserves key computational principles while enabling efficient digital implementation. The weighting of inputs allows the network to learn which connections are important, just as biological neural networks strengthen or weaken synaptic connections through experience. The summation operation captures how biological neurons integrate multiple inputs into a single decision. The activation function introduces nonlinearity essential for learning complex patterns, much like the threshold-based firing of biological neurons.

Memory in artificial neural networks takes a markedly different form from biological systems. While biological memories are distributed across synaptic connections and neural patterns, artificial networks store information in discrete weights and parameters. This architectural difference reflects the constraints of current computing hardware, where memory and processing are physically separated rather than integrated as in biological systems. Despite these implementation differences, artificial neural networks achieve similar functional capabilities in pattern recognition and learning.

The brain's massive parallelism finds a limited analog in modern AI hardware. While biological neural networks process information through billions of neurons operating simultaneously, artificial systems approximate this parallelism through specialized hardware like GPUs and tensor processing units. These devices efficiently compute the matrix operations that form the mathematical foundation of artificial neural networks, achieving parallel processing at a different scale and granularity than biological systems.

To summarize these translations, @tbl-bio2comp provides a systematic view of how key biological features map to their computational counterparts. As we can see from the table, each biological feature finds an analog in computational systems, though often in a simplified or abstracted form. These translations, while preserving essential computational properties, create specific demands on the computing systems that must implement them.

#### System Requirements

The translation of biological principles into artificial neural systems creates specific demands on computing infrastructure. These requirements emerge directly from the fundamental differences between biological and artificial implementations of neural processing.

The computational elements we identified in our biological-to-computational translation each create specific demands on the computing infrastructure. @tbl-comp2sys shows how each computational element drives particular system requirements. From this mapping, we can see how the choices made in computational translation directly influence the hardware and system architecture needed for implementation.

+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| Computational Element | System Requirements             |
+:======================+:================================+
| Activation functions  | Fast nonlinear operation units  |
+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| Weight operations     | High-bandwidth memory access    |
+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| Parallel computation  | Specialized parallel processors |
+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| Weight storage        | Large-scale memory systems      |
+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| Learning algorithms   | Gradient computation hardware   |
+-----------------------+---------------------------------+

: From computation to system requirements. {#tbl-comp2sys .striped .hover}

The first major requirement stems from the challenge of replicating the brain's parallel processing capabilities. While biological neurons operate naturally in parallel across billions of units, artificial systems must explicitly architect for parallelism. This necessitates specialized processors capable of handling many simultaneous calculations, fundamentally different from traditional sequential computing architectures. Unlike the brain's distributed processing, our artificial systems must coordinate these parallel operations through carefully designed hardware and software structures.

Storage architecture represents another crucial requirement, driven by the fundamental difference in how biological and artificial systems handle memory. In biological systems, memory and processing are intrinsically integratedâ€”synapses both store connection strengths and process signals. Artificial systems, however, must maintain a clear separation between processing units and memory. This creates a need for both high-capacity storage to hold millions or billions of connection weights and high-bandwidth pathways to move this data quickly between storage and processing units. The efficiency of this data movement often becomes a critical bottleneck that biological systems do not face.

The learning process itself imposes distinct requirements on artificial systems. While biological networks modify synaptic strengths through local chemical processes, artificial networks must coordinate weight updates across the entire network. This creates substantial computational and memory demands during trainingâ€”systems must not only store current weights but also maintain space for gradients and intermediate calculations. The requirement to backpropagate error signals, with no real biological analog, further complicates the system architecture.

Energy efficiency emerges as a final critical requirement, highlighting perhaps the starkest contrast between biological and artificial implementations. The human brain's remarkable energy efficiencyâ€”operating on roughly 20 wattsâ€”stands in sharp contrast to the substantial power demands of artificial neural networks. Current systems often require orders of magnitude more energy to implement similar capabilities. This gap drives ongoing research in more efficient hardware architectures and has profound implications for the practical deployment of neural networks, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices or edge computing systems.

#### Evolution and Impact

The evolution of deep learning systems reflects a complex interplay between algorithmic advances, hardware capabilities, and growing computational demands. This journey began with early artificial neural networks in the 1950s, marked by the introduction of the Perceptron [@rosenblatt1957perceptron]. While groundbreaking in concept, these early systems were severely limited by the computational capabilities of their eraâ€”primarily mainframe computers that lacked both the processing power and memory capacity needed for complex networks.

The development of backpropagation algorithms in the 1980s [@rumelhart1986learning], which we will learn about later, represented a  theoretical breakthrough and povided a systematic way to train multi-layer networks. However, the computational demands of this algorithm far exceeded available hardware capabilities. Training even modest networks could take weeks, making experimentation and practical applications challenging. This mismatch between algorithmic requirements and hardware capabilities contributed to a period of reduced interest in neural networks.

The term "deep learning" gained prominence in the 2000s, coinciding with significant advances in computational power and data accessibility. The field has since experienced exponential growth, as illustrated in @fig-trends. The graph reveals two remarkable trends: computational capabilities measured in the number of Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPS) initially followed a 1.4x improvement pattern from 1952 to 2010, then accelerated to a 3.4-month doubling cycle from 2012 to 2022. Perhaps more striking is the emergence of large-scale models between 2015 and 2022 (not explicitly shown or easily seen in the figure), which scaled 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the general trend, following an aggressive 10-month doubling cycle.

#### Key Breakthroughs

The success of deep learning has been driven by parallel advances across three fundamental dimensions: data availability, algorithmic innovations, and computing infrastructure.

These three factorsâ€”data, algorithms, and infrastructureâ€”reinforced each other. As @fig-virtuous-cycle shows, more powerful computing infrastructure enabled processing larger datasets. Larger datasets drove algorithmic innovations. Better algorithms demanded more sophisticated computing systems. This virtuous cycle continues to drive progress in the field today.

![The virtuous cycle enabled by key breakthroughs in each layer.](images/png/virtuous-cycle.png){#fig-virtuous-cycle width=40%}

The data revolution transformed what was possible with neural networks. The rise of the internet and digital devices created unprecedented access to training data. Image sharing platforms provided millions of labeled images. Digital text collections enabled language processing at scale. Sensor networks and IoT devices generated continuous streams of real-world data. This abundance of data provided the raw material needed for neural networks to learn complex patterns effectively.

Algorithmic innovations made it possible to harness this data effectively. New methods for initializing networks and controlling learning rates made training more stable. Techniques for preventing overfitting allowed models to generalize better to new data. Most importantly, researchers discovered that neural network performance scaled predictably with model size, computation, and data quantity, leading to increasingly ambitious architectures.

Computing infrastructure evolved to meet these growing demands. On the hardware side, graphics processing units (GPUs) provided the parallel processing capabilities needed for efficient neural network computation. Specialized AI accelerators like TPUs [@jouppi2017datacenter] pushed performance further. High-bandwidth memory systems and fast interconnects addressed data movement challenges. Equally important were software advancesâ€”frameworks and libraries that made it easier to build and train networks, distributed computing systems that enabled training at scale, and tools for optimizing model deployment.
