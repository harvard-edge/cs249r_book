This chapter is a primer on deep learning from a systems perspective, providing us with essential context and the foundational knowledge that is needed to implement and optimize deep learning solutions effectively. ML systems represents the bridge between theoretical machine learning concepts and their practical implementation in real-world computing systems. Our goal is to help readers understand how theoretical constructs translate into computational requirements, resource constraints, and system design decisions.

We begin with an overview of deep learning's evolution and its significance in modern computing systems, from edge devices to data centers. We introduce the core concepts like neural networks with a dual focus: first understanding their theoretical foundations, then examining their practical implications for system implementation. The primer explores major deep learning architectures through this systems lens, examining how architectural choices impact compute, memory, and communication requirements.

We then analyze common computational patterns in deep learning and their implications for system design. We examine how different architectures translate to specific hardware demands, software stack requirements, and deployment considerations. Through practical case studies, we demonstrate how these concepts apply to real-world scenarios, from scaling large language models to optimizing models for edge devices. We also compare deep learning to traditional machine learning approaches, helping readers make informed architectural choices based on system constraints and requirements. This comprehensive overview sets the context for the more detailed techniques and optimizations covered in subsequent chapters.

## Overview

### Definition and Context

Deep learning, a specialized area within machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), utilizes algorithms modeled after the structure and function of neural networks to process and learn from large amounts of data. From a systems perspective, deep learning represents a unique intersection of algorithms, hardware, and software infrastructure working together to solve complex computational problems.

When implementing deep learning in real-world systems, we need to consider it as part of a broader computing stack. @fig-ai-ml-dl provides a visual representation of how deep learning fits within the broader context of AI and machine learning. As shown in the figure, AI represents the overarching field, encompassing all computational methods that mimic human cognitive functions. Machine learning, shown as a subset of AI, includes algorithms capable of learning from data. Deep learning, the smallest subset in the diagram, specifically involves neural networks that are able to learn more complex patterns from large volumes of data.

This progression from AI to deep learning represents key shifts across three fundamental dimensions:

1. **Data**: From structured, rule-based knowledge to massive datasets of raw, unstructured information. Deep learning's ability to learn from raw data eliminates the need for manual feature engineering but demands substantially larger datasets.

2. **Algorithms**: From explicit programming to learned patterns. While traditional AI relies on handcrafted rules and machine learning uses statistical methods, deep learning algorithms automatically discover hierarchical representations in data through multiple layers of abstraction.

3. **Computation**: From basic arithmetic operations to massive parallel processing. The computational demands grow significantly as we move from simple AI algorithms to complex deep neural networks, driving innovations in specialized hardware and distributed computing.

This evolution has profound implications for how we build and deploy AI systems. Deep learning's appetite for data and computation has spurred developments in specialized hardware like GPUs and TPUs, scalable software frameworks, and efficient data pipelines. Understanding these relationships is important for effectively implementing deep learning solutions across different computing environments, from powerful data centers to resource-constrained edge devices.

To build this understanding, we must start with the fundamentals. In the following sections, we first examine the historical development and computational growth of deep learning systems. We then explore core neural network concepts, focusing on how theoretical principles translate into practical implementations. This foundation will enable us to better understand modern architectures, their computational patterns, and ultimately, how to build effective deep learning systems.

## Understanding Deep Learning

### What Makes Deep Learning Different

Deep learning represents a fundamental shift in how we approach problem solving with computers. To understand this shift, let's consider the classic example of computer vision---specifically, the task of identifying objects in images. 

#### Traditional Programming: The Era of Explicit Rules

Traditional programming requires developers to explicitly define rules that tell computers how to process inputs and produce outputs. Consider a simple game like Breakout, shown in @fig-breakout. The program needs explicit rules for every interaction: when the ball hits a brick, the code must specify that the brick should be removed and the ball's direction should be reversed. While this approach works well for games with clear physics and limited states, it demonstrates an inherent limitation of rule-based systems.

![Rule-based programming.](images/png/breakout.png){#fig-breakout}

This rules-based paradigm extends to all traditional programming, as illustrated in @fig-traditional. The program takes both rules for processing and input data to produce outputs. Early artificial intelligence research explored whether this approach could scale to solve complex problems by encoding sufficient rules to capture intelligent behavior.

![Traditional programming.](images/png/traditional.png){#fig-traditional}

However, the limitations of rule-based approaches become evident when addressing complex real-world tasks. Consider the problem of recognizing human activities, shown in @fig-activity-rules. Initial rules might appear straightforward: classify movement below 4 mph as walking and faster movement as running. Yet real-world complexity quickly emerges. The classification must account for variations in speed, transitions between activities, and numerous edge cases. Each new consideration requires additional rules, leading to increasingly complex decision trees.

![Activity rules.](images/png/activities.png){#fig-activity-rules}

This challenge extends to computer vision tasks. Detecting objects like cats in images would require rules about characteristic features: pointed ears, whiskers, typical body shapes. Such rules would need to account for variations in viewing angle, lighting conditions, partial occlusions, and natural variations among instances. Early computer vision systems attempted this approach through geometric rules but achieved success only in controlled environments with well-defined objects.

This knowledge engineering approach characterized artificial intelligence research in the 1970s and 1980s. Expert systems encoded domain knowledge as explicit rules, showing promise in specific domains with well-defined parameters but struggling with tasks humans perform naturally---such as object recognition, speech understanding, or natural language interpretation. These limitations highlighted a fundamental challenge: many aspects of intelligent behavior rely on implicit knowledge that resists explicit rule-based representation.

#### Machine Learning: Learning from Engineered Patterns

The limitations of pure rule-based systems led researchers to explore approaches that could learn from data. Machine learning offered a promising direction: instead of writing rules for every situation, we could write programs that found patterns in examples. However, the success of these methods still depended heavily on human insight to define what patterns might be important---a process known as feature engineering.

Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into representations that make patterns more apparent to learning algorithms. In computer vision, researchers developed sophisticated methods to extract meaningful patterns from images. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method, shown in @fig-hog, exemplifies this approach. HOG works by first identifying edges in an image---places where brightness changes sharply, often indicating object boundaries. It then divides the image into small cells and measures how edges are oriented within each cell, summarizing these orientations in a histogram. This transformation converts raw pixel values into a representation that captures important shape information while being robust to variations in lighting and small changes in position.

![Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) requires explicit feature engineering.](images/png/hog.png){#fig-hog}

Other feature extraction methods like SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and Gabor filters provided different ways to capture patterns in images. SIFT found distinctive points that could be recognized even when an object's size or orientation changed. Gabor filters helped identify textures and repeated patterns. Each method encoded different types of human insight about what makes visual patterns recognizable.

These engineered features enabled significant advances in computer vision during the 2000s. Systems could now recognize objects with some robustness to real-world variations, leading to applications in face detection, pedestrian detection, and object recognition. However, the approach had fundamental limitations. Experts needed to carefully design feature extractors for each new problem, and the resulting features might miss important patterns that weren't anticipated in their design.

#### Deep Learning

Deep learning fundamentally differs by learning directly from raw data. Traditional programming, as we saw earlier in @fig-traditional, required both rules and data as inputs to produce answers. Machine learning inverts this relationship, as shown in @fig-deeplearning. Instead of writing rules, we provide examples (data) and their correct answers to discover the underlying rules automatically. This shift eliminates the need for humans to specify what patterns are important.

![Deep learning.](images/png/ml_rules.png){#fig-deeplearning}

The system discovers these patterns automatically from examples. When shown millions of images of cats, the system learns to identify increasingly complex visual patterns---from simple edges to more sophisticated combinations that make up cat-like features. This mirrors how our own visual system works, building up understanding from basic visual elements to complex objects.

Unlike traditional approaches where performance often plateaus with more data and computation, deep learning systems continue to improve as we provide more resources. More training examples help the system recognize more variations and nuances. More computational power enables the system to discover more subtle patterns. This scalability has led to dramatic improvements in performance---for example, the accuracy of image recognition systems has improved from 74% in 2012 to over 95% today.

This different approach has profound implications for how we build AI systems. Deep learning's ability to learn directly from raw data eliminates the need for manual feature engineering, but it comes with new demands. We need sophisticated infrastructure to handle massive datasets, powerful computers to process this data, and specialized hardware to perform the complex mathematical calculations efficiently. The computational requirements of deep learning have even driven the development of new types of computer chips optimized for these calculations.

The success of deep learning in computer vision exemplifies how this approach, when given sufficient data and computation, can surpass traditional methods. This pattern has repeated across many domains, from speech recognition to game playing, establishing deep learning as a transformative approach to artificial intelligence.
