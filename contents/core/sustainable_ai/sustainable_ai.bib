  abstract = {Abstract Eco-friendliness is becoming an indispensable feature for electrical and electronic equipment to thrive in the competitive market. This comprehensive review is the first to define eco-friendly electronics in its multiple meanings: power saving devices, end-of-life impact attenuators, equipment whose manufacturing uses green processing, electronics that use materials that minimize environmental and health risks, designs that improve lifespan, reparability, etc. More specifically, this review discusses eco-friendly technologies and materials that are being introduced to replace the well-established ones. This is done for all material classes (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Manufacturing, recycling, and final product characteristics are discussed in their various interconnected aspects. Additionally, the concept of consciously planned obsolescence is introduced to address the paradoxical relationship between durability and efficiency. The overall conclusions are that there is an important global trend to make electronics more eco-friendly. However, matching the performance and stability of well-established materials and technologies seems to be the main barrier to achieve it. These new implementations can have detrimental or beneficial net impacts on the environment. Assessing their net outcome is challenging because their impacts are frequently unknown and the current evaluation methods (and tools) are incapable of comprehensively quantifying these impacts and generating reliable verdicts.},

  title = {A review of data center cooling technology, operating conditions and the corresponding low-grade waste heat recovery opportunities},
  abstract = {The depletion of the world's limited reservoirs of fossil fuels, the worldwide impact of global warming and the high cost of energy are among the primary issues driving a renewed interest in the capture and reuse of waste energy. A major source of waste energy is being created by data centers through the increasing demand for cloud based connectivity and performance. In fact, recent figures show that data centers are responsible for more than 2\% of the US total electricity usage. Almost half of this power is used for cooling the electronics, creating a significant stream of waste heat. The difficulty associated with recovering and reusing this stream of waste heat is that the heat is of low quality. In this paper, the most promising methods and technologies for recovering data center low-grade waste heat in an effective and economically reasonable way are identified and discussed. A number of currently available and developmental low-grade waste heat recovery techniques including district/plant/water heating, absorption cooling, direct power generation (piezoelectric and thermoelectric), indirect power generation (steam and organic Rankine cycle), biomass co-location, and desalination/clean water are reviewed along with their operational requirements in order to assess the suitability and effectiveness of each technology for data center applications. Based on a comparison between data centers' operational thermodynamic conditions and the operational requirements of the discussed waste heat recovery techniques, absorption cooling and organic Rankine cycle are found to be among the most promising technologies for data center waste heat reuse.},

The ultimate goal of this research is to create paths for the production of human- and environmentally friendly electronics in general and the integration of such electronic circuits with living tissue in particular. Researching into the emerging class of “green” electronics may help fulfill not only the original promise of organic electronics that is to deliver low-cost and energy efficient materials and devices but also achieve unimaginable functionalities for electronics, for example benign integration into life and environment. This Review will highlight recent research advancements in this emerging group of materials and their integration in unconventional organic electronic devices.},

  urldate = {2023-12-01},
  abstract = {This paper studies government subsidies for green technology adoption while considering the manufacturing industry's response. Government subsidies offered directly to consumers impact the supplier's production and pricing decisions. Our analysis expands the current understanding of the price-setting newsvendor model, incorporating the external influence from the government, who is now an additional player in the system. We quantify how demand uncertainty impacts the various players (government, industry, and consumers) when designing policies. We further show that, for convex demand functions, an increase in demand uncertainty leads to higher production quantities and lower prices, resulting in lower profits for the supplier. With this in mind, one could expect consumer surplus to increase with uncertainty. In fact, we show that this is not always the case and that the uncertainty impact on consumer surplus depends on the trade-off between lower prices and the possibility of underserving customers with high valuations. We also show that when policy makers such as governments ignore demand uncertainty when designing consumer subsidies, they can significantly miss the desired adoption target level. From a coordination perspective, we demonstrate that the decentralized decisions are also optimal for a central planner managing jointly the supplier and the government. As a result, subsidies provide a coordination mechanism.},

  title = {Energy efficiency and low carbon enabler green IT framework for data centers considering green metrics},
  abstract = {The increasing demand for storage, networking and computation has driven intensification of large complex data centers that run many of today's Internet, financial, commercial and business applications. A data center comprises of many thousands of servers and can use as much energy as small city. Massive amount of computation power is required to drive and run these server farms resulting in many challenging like huge energy consumptions, emission of green house gases, backups and recovery; This paper proposes energy efficiency and low carbon enabler green IT framework for these large and complex server farms to save consumption of electricity and reduce the emission of green house gases to lower the effects of global warming. The framework uses latest energy saving techniques like virtualization, cloud computing and green metrics to achieve greener data centers. It comprises of five phase to properly implement green IT techniques to achieve green data centers. The proposed framework seamlessly divides data center components into different resource pools and then applies green metrics like Power Usage Effectiveness, Data Center Effectiveness and Carbon Emission Calculator to measure performance of individual components so that benchmarking values can be achieved and set as standard to be followed by data centers.},
