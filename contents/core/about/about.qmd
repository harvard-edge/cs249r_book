# About the Book {.unnumbered}

## Overview

Welcome to this collaborative textbook. It originated as part of the **CS249r: Tiny Machine Learning** course that Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi teaches at Harvard University. The goal of this book is to provide a resource for educators and learners seeking to understand the principles and practices of machine learning systems. 

This book is continually updated to incorporate the latest insights and effective teaching strategies with the intent that it remains a valuable resource in this fast-evolving field.

## What's Inside the Book

This textbook explores the foundational principles, practical workflows, and critical challenges of building and deploying machine learning systems. Starting with a grounding in **foundational concepts**, it progresses through the **engineering principles** essential for system design and optimization, and then examines the key **considerations for operationalizing AI systems**. The book concludes by reflecting on the broader societal and technological implications of machine learning.

A unique feature of this book is its ability to connect readers with seminal scholarly works and academic research, encouraging deeper exploration and critical engagement with the subject. This bridge between pedagogical materials and cutting-edge research provides a well-rounded perspective, making it an invaluable guide for students, practitioners, and researchers alike.

To enhance the learning experience, this book includes supplementary resources such as:

- **Slides** summarizing key concepts.
- **Videos** offering in-depth explanations and demonstrations.
- **Exercises** to reinforce understanding.
- **Labs** providing hands-on experience with real-world tools and techniques.

Please note that these resources are a major work in progress, designed to cater to diverse learning styles and provide readers with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

## Topics Explored

The textbook is structured into four main parts, each addressing important aspects of engineering machine learning systems. Readers will gain a holistic understanding of machine learning systems, from foundational principles to advanced applications, and learn how to navigate the complexities of AI deployment across diverse domains.

### PART I: Foundations

The first part establishes the theoretical and computational underpinnings of ML systems. It introduces core concepts and explores the architectures that form the basis of modern AI systems.

### PART II: Engineering Principles

This section delves into the workflows, frameworks, and optimization strategies necessary for designing and deploying robust, efficient ML systems. It emphasizes practical approaches to tackling challenges in system design and implementation.

### PART III: AI in Practice

This part focuses on the important considerations that go into successfully operationalizing AI in real-world settings. Topics include security, privacy, ethical AI, sustainability, robustness, and advanced deployment techniques like on-device learning.

### PART IV: Closing Perspectives

The book concludes with a reflective synthesis of the material covered, offering insights into future trends and the societal implications of machine learning systems.

## Key Learning Outcomes

This book is structured with [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/) in mind, which is a widely used framework for classifying learning objectives by cognitive complexity. Developed by Benjamin Bloom and collaborators, @fig-bloom shows that this taxonomy defines six levels of learning, ranging from foundational knowledge to advanced creative thinking:

![Bloom's Taxonomy (2021 edition).](images/png/bloom_revised_taxonomy.png){#fig-bloom}

Starting from the bottom: 

1. **Remembering**: Recalling basic facts and concepts.  
2. **Understanding**: Explaining ideas or processes.  
3. **Applying**: Using knowledge in new situations.  
4. **Analyzing**: Breaking down information into components.
5. **Evaluating**: Making judgments based on criteria and standards.  
6. **Creating**: Producing original work or solutions.  

By organizing learning objectives around these levels, this book ensures a progression that supports readers from grasping foundational concepts to exploring advanced, real-world applications. Each chapter targets offers a mix of theoretical insights, practical workflows, and reflective activities.
