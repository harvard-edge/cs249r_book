# About the Book {.unnumbered}

## Overview

Welcome to this collaborative textbook, which originated as part of the **CS249r Tiny Machine Learning** course at Harvard University. The goal of this book is to provide a resource for educators and learners seeking to understand the principles and practices of machine learning systems. This book is continually updated to incorporate the latest insights and effective teaching strategies with the intent that it remains a valuable resource in this fast-evolving field.

## What's Inside the Book

This textbook explores the foundational principles, practical workflows, and critical challenges of building and deploying machine learning systems. Starting with a grounding in **foundational concepts**, it progresses through the **engineering principles** essential for system design and optimization, and then examines the key **considerations for operationalizing AI systems**. The book concludes by reflecting on the broader societal and technological implications of machine learning.

A unique feature of this book is its ability to connect readers with seminal scholarly works and academic research, encouraging deeper exploration and critical engagement with the subject. This bridge between pedagogical materials and cutting-edge research provides a well-rounded perspective, making it an invaluable guide for students, practitioners, and researchers alike.

To enhance the learning experience, this book includes supplementary resources such as.
- **Slides** summarizing key concepts.
- **Videos** offering in-depth explanations and demonstrations.
- **Exercises** to reinforce understanding.
- **Labs** providing hands-on experience with real-world tools and techniques.

These resources are a major work in progress, designed to cater to diverse learning styles and provide readers with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

## Topics Explored

The textbook is structured into four main parts, each addressing a critical aspect of machine learning systems:

### PART I: Foundations
