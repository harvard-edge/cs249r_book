## Purpose {.unnumbered}

_How does enabling learning directly on edge devices reshape machine learning system design, and what strategies support adaptation under resource constraints?_

The shift toward on-device learning marks a significant evolution in the deployment and maintenance of machine learning systems. Rather than relying exclusively on centralized infrastructure, models are now increasingly expected to adapt in situ—updating and improving directly on the devices where they operate. This approach introduces a new design space, where training must occur within stringent constraints on memory, compute, energy, and data availability. In these settings, the balance between model adaptability, system efficiency, and deployment scalability becomes critical. This chapter examines the architectural, algorithmic, and infrastructure-level techniques that enable effective learning on the edge, and outlines the principles required to support autonomous model improvement in resource-constrained environments.

## Overview

Machine learning systems have traditionally treated model training and model inference as distinct phases, often separated by both time and infrastructure. Training occurs in the cloud, leveraging large-scale compute clusters and curated datasets, while inference is performed downstream on deployed models—typically on user devices or edge servers. However, this separation is beginning to erode. Increasingly, devices are being equipped not just to run inference, but to adapt, personalize, and improve models locally.

On-device learning refers to the process of training or adapting machine learning models directly on the device where they are deployed. This capability opens the door to systems that can personalize models in response to user behavior, operate without cloud connectivity, and respect stringent privacy constraints by keeping data local. It also introduces a new set of challenges: devices have limited memory, computational power, and energy. Furthermore, training data is often sparse, noisy, or non-independent across users. These limitations necessitate a fundamental rethinking of training algorithms, system architecture, and deployment strategies.

**On-Device Learning** is the _local adaptation or training_ of machine learning models directly on deployed hardware devices, without reliance on continuous connectivity to centralized servers. It enables _personalization, privacy preservation, and autonomous operation_ by leveraging user-specific data collected in situ. On-device learning systems must operate under _tight constraints on compute, memory, energy, and data availability_, requiring specialized methods for model optimization, training efficiency, and data representation. As on-device learning matures, it increasingly incorporates _federated collaboration, lifelong adaptation, and secure execution_, expanding the frontier of intelligent edge computing.

This chapter explores the principles and systems design considerations underpinning on-device learning. It begins by examining the motivating applications that necessitate learning on the device, followed by a discussion of the unique hardware constraints introduced by embedded and mobile environments. The chapter then develops a taxonomy of strategies for adapting models, algorithms, and data pipelines to these constraints. Particular emphasis is placed on distributed and collaborative methods, such as federated learning, which enable decentralized training without direct data sharing. The chapter concludes with an analysis of outstanding challenges, including issues related to reliability, system validation, and the heterogeneity of deployment environments.

## Motivation

Machine learning systems have traditionally relied on centralized training pipelines, where models are developed and refined using large, curated datasets and powerful cloud-based infrastructure. Once trained, these models are deployed to client devices for inference. While this separation has served most use cases well, it imposes limitations in settings where local data is dynamic, private, or personalized. On-device learning challenges this model by enabling systems to train or adapt directly on the device, without relying on constant connectivity to the cloud.

## Why Learn On the Device

Traditional machine learning systems rely on a clear division of labor between model training and inference. Training is performed in centralized environments with access to high-performance compute resources and large-scale datasets. Once trained, models are distributed to client devices, where they operate in a static inference-only mode. While this centralized paradigm has been effective in many deployments, it introduces limitations in settings where data is user-specific, behavior is dynamic, or connectivity is intermittent.

On-device learning refers to the capability of a deployed device to perform model adaptation using locally available data. This shift from centralized to decentralized learning is motivated by four key considerations: personalization, latency and availability, privacy, and infrastructure efficiency.

Personalization is a primary motivation. Deployed models often encounter usage patterns and data distributions that differ substantially from their training environments. Local adaptation enables models to refine behavior in response to user-specific data—capturing linguistic preferences, physiological baselines, sensor characteristics, or environmental conditions. This is particularly important in applications with high inter-user variability, where a single global model may fail to serve all users equally well.

Latency and availability further justify local learning. In edge computing scenarios, connectivity to centralized infrastructure may be unreliable, delayed, or intentionally limited to preserve bandwidth or reduce energy usage. On-device learning enables autonomous improvement of models even in fully offline or delay-sensitive contexts, where round-trip updates to the cloud are infeasible.

Privacy is another critical factor. Many applications involve sensitive or regulated data, including biometric measurements, typed input, location traces, or health information. Transmitting such data to the cloud introduces privacy risks and compliance burdens. Local learning mitigates these concerns by keeping raw data on the device and operating within privacy-preserving boundaries—potentially aiding adherence to regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or region-specific data sovereignty laws.

Infrastructure efficiency also plays a role. Centralized training pipelines require substantial backend infrastructure to collect, store, and process user data. At scale, this introduces bottlenecks in bandwidth, compute capacity, and energy consumption. By shifting learning to the edge, systems can reduce communication costs and distribute training workloads across the deployment fleet, relieving pressure on centralized resources.

These motivations collectively reflect a shift in machine learning system design—from static, cloud-trained models to dynamic, distributed systems capable of learning at the edge. However, supporting this shift introduces new technical challenges. Training on-device must respect tight resource constraints, including limited memory, low-power compute, restricted runtime visibility, and fragmented deployment environments. Achieving useful, safe, and efficient learning in this context requires new approaches to model design, optimization, and data handling.

These principles are already shaping the design of real-world systems, including mobile keyboards, wearable sensors, and voice-driven interfaces. We now turn to several concrete application domains where on-device learning is actively being explored and deployed.

### Application Domains

The motivations for on-device learning are most clearly illustrated by examining the application domains where its benefits are both tangible and necessary. These domains span consumer technologies, healthcare, industrial systems, and embedded applications, each presenting scenarios where local adaptation is preferable—or required—for effective machine learning deployment.

**Mobile input prediction** is a mature example. In systems such as smartphone keyboards, predictive text and autocorrect features benefit substantially from continuous adaptation. User typing patterns are highly personal and evolve over time. On-device learning enables local language models to finetune their predictions without transmitting keystroke data to a remote server. Google’s Gboard, for instance, uses federated learning to refine shared models across devices while preserving user privacy.

**Wearable and health monitoring devices** also present strong use cases. These systems often rely on real-time data from accelerometers, heart rate sensors, or electrodermal activity monitors. However, physiological baselines vary significantly between individuals. On-device learning allows models to adapt to these baselines over time, improving the accuracy of activity recognition, stress detection, and sleep staging. Moreover, in regulated healthcare environments, patient data must remain localized due to privacy laws, further reinforcing the need for edge-local adaptation.

**Wake-word detection and voice interfaces** illustrate another critical scenario. Devices such as smart speakers and earbuds must recognize voice commands quickly and accurately, even in noisy or dynamic acoustic environments. Local training enables models to adapt to the user’s voice profile and ambient context, reducing false positives and missed detections. This kind of adaptation is particularly valuable in far-field audio settings, where microphone configurations and room acoustics vary widely across deployments.

**Industrial IoT and remote monitoring systems** also benefit from local learning capabilities. In applications such as agricultural sensing, pipeline monitoring, or environmental surveillance, connectivity to centralized infrastructure may be limited or costly. On-device learning allows these systems to detect anomalies, adjust thresholds, or adapt to seasonal trends without continuous communication with the cloud. This capability is critical for maintaining autonomy and reliability in edge-deployed sensor networks.

**Embedded computer vision systems**, including those in robotics, AR/VR, and smart cameras, present additional opportunities. These systems often operate in novel or evolving environments that differ significantly from training conditions. On-device adaptation allows models to recalibrate to new lighting conditions, object appearances, or motion patterns, maintaining task accuracy over time.

Each of these domains highlights a common pattern: the deployment environment introduces variation or uncertainty that cannot be fully anticipated during centralized training. On-device learning offers a mechanism for adapting models in place, enabling systems to improve continuously in response to local conditions. These examples also reveal a critical design requirement: learning must be performed efficiently, privately, and reliably under significant resource constraints. The following section formalizes these constraints and outlines the system-level considerations that shape the design of on-device learning solutions.

### Centralized vs. Decentralized Training

Most machine learning systems today follow a centralized learning paradigm. Models are trained in data centers using large-scale, curated datasets aggregated from many sources. Once trained, these models are deployed to client devices in a static form, where they perform inference without further modification. Updates to model parameters—whether to incorporate new data or improve generalization—are handled periodically through offline retraining, often using newly collected or labeled data sent back from the field.

This centralized model of learning offers numerous advantages: high-performance computing infrastructure, access to diverse data distributions, and robust debugging and validation pipelines. However, it also depends on reliable data transfer, trust in data custodianship, and infrastructure capable of managing global updates across a fleet of devices. As machine learning is deployed into increasingly diverse and distributed environments, the limitations of this approach become more apparent.

In contrast, on-device learning is inherently decentralized. Each device maintains its own copy of a model and adapts it locally using data that is typically unavailable to centralized infrastructure. Training occurs on-device, often asynchronously and under varying resource conditions. Data never leaves the device, reducing exposure but also complicating coordination. Devices may differ substantially in their hardware capabilities, runtime environments, and patterns of use, making the learning process heterogeneous and difficult to standardize.

This decentralized nature introduces unique systems challenges. Devices may operate with different versions of the model, leading to inconsistencies in behavior. Evaluation and validation become more complex, as there is no central point from which to measure performance. Model updates must be carefully managed to prevent degradation, and safety guarantees become harder to enforce in the absence of centralized testing.

At the same time, decentralization introduces opportunities. It allows for personalization without centralized oversight, supports learning in disconnected or bandwidth-limited environments, and reduces the cost of infrastructure for model updates. It also raises important questions of how to coordinate learning across devices, whether through periodic synchronization, federated aggregation, or hybrid approaches that combine local and global objectives.

The move from centralized to decentralized learning thus represents more than a shift in deployment architecture—it reshapes the design space for machine learning systems. The remainder of this chapter focuses on the methods and system strategies that enable on-device learning under real-world constraints. To begin, we formalize the hardware, software, and operational limitations that guide the design of these systems.
