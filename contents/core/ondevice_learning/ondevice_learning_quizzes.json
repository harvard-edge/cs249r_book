The section does not delve into specific technical tradeoffs, system components, or operational implications that would require active understanding and application by students. It also does not introduce new technical concepts or design decisions that build on previous knowledge in a way that necessitates reinforcement. Therefore, a self-check quiz is not needed at this stage, as the section is more descriptive and contextual rather than actionable or deeply technical."
