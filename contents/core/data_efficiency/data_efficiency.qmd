## Purpose {.unnumbered}

_How does data influence the efficiency of machine learning systems?_

Machine learning advances have traditionally emphasized algorithmic improvements and system optimizations. Researchers and practitioners focused on developing faster training methods, reducing model complexity, and optimizing hardware utilization. While these approaches yielded significant gains, they addressed only two of the three fundamental pillars of machine learning: algorithms and systems. Data efficiency, the third pillar, remained underexplored despite its profound impact on system performance and scalability. The volume and velocity of data moving through machine learning pipelines affect computation requirements, memory usage, and energy consumption. Understanding data efficiency uncovers optimization opportunities beyond model architecture and hardware utilization. Each data-centric decision influences training time, resource allocation, and inference speed, demonstrating how data shapes overall system efficiency. Examining this overlooked dimension enables machine learning systems that optimize across all three pillars, leading to implementations that achieve better performance with fewer resources.

## Overview

Advances in models and computational systems have largely driven the evolution of artificial intelligence. Deep learning, transformer architectures, and improved hardware accelerators have dramatically enhanced AI capabilities across domains - from image recognition to natural language processing. Introducing models like GPT and BERT has transformed text-based AI, while specialized hardware such as GPUs and TPUs has enabled increasingly powerful and scalable model training.

Yet despite these impressive technological strides, a fundamental limitation has become apparent: even the most sophisticated models cannot reach their full potential without high-quality, well-curated data. While AI architectures have evolved rapidly, data quality and curation remain surprisingly overlooked factors in determining model performance. This represents a significant missed opportunity, as data optimization could unlock major efficiency, generalization, and robustness improvements across machine learning systems.

The scientific study of data's role in AI is still in its early stages. We are beginning to develop systematic approaches for managing, refining, and leveraging data to build more capable machine learning systems. Though new methodologies and best practices continue to emerge, many fundamental questions remain unexplored.

This chapter examines the growing recognition of data's critical importance in machine learning development, marking a shift from purely model-centric approaches toward data-centric strategies. We explore key dimensions, including data quality, quantity, diversity, and usability, while introducing techniques like active learning, self-supervised learning, and transfer learning for dataset optimization to develop a systematic taxonomy of how to solve problems. The discussion encompasses metrics for evaluating data efficiency, tools for data management, and real-world applications that demonstrate data-centric AI's impact. Our goal is to provide a view of this rapidly evolving field by examining current challenges and future research directions.

## Data-centric AI

### Definition

Artificial intelligence has traditionally been propelled by advancements in model architectures and computational power. The rise of deep learning, transformer-based models, and specialized machine learning accelerators has driven breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and decision-making systems. However, as machine learning systems scale, researchers and practitioners have increasingly recognized that models alone are not the primary determinant of performance. Instead, the quality, availability, and curation of data play an equally—if not more—critical role in shaping machine learning outcomes.

Data-Centric AI (DCAI) is an emerging paradigm that shifts the focus from model development to data improvement as the key driver of machine learning performance. Rather than solely optimizing architectures and hyperparameters, DCAI emphasizes systematically curating, managing, and refining datasets to enhance AI model effectiveness. This approach acknowledges that well-structured, high-quality data can reduce reliance on excessive computational resources, enhance model generalization, improve robustness, and mitigate bias—leading to more reliable and ethical AI systems.

::: {.callout-note title="Definition of Data-Centric AI"}

**Data-Centric AI (DCAI)** refers to an approach that prioritizes data quality, diversity, and usability as the primary drivers of AI system performance. Unlike model-centric AI, which emphasizes refining architectures and increasing computational resources, DCAI systematically curates, manages, and optimizes datasets to enhance model effectiveness. By improving data rather than solely focusing on models, DCAI creates more robust, generalizable, and efficient machine learning systems that require fewer computational resources and exhibit reduced bias.

### From Model-Centric Era to the Data-Centric Era

For decades, artificial intelligence research and development have been predominantly model-centric. The prevailing belief was that improving models—by refining architectures, increasing parameter counts, and optimizing hyperparameters—was the key to achieving better machine learning performance. This model-driven approach shaped the evolution of AI, leading to significant milestones across different eras of machine learning development.

#### The Model-Centric Era: A Historical Perspective

##### 1950s–1980s: Rule-Based AI Systems

Early machine learning systems were built on manually coded rules and logic-based reasoning. These systems, known as expert systems, relied on predefined knowledge rather than learning from data, which limited their adaptability.

##### 1990s: The Rise of Statistical Learning

The shift from rule-based machine learning to data-driven approaches began with the advent of machine learning techniques, including decision trees, support vector machines, and early neural networks. These models required structured and well-labeled datasets but remained computationally constrained.

##### 2010s: The Deep Learning Revolution

With the resurgence of deep learning, fueled by the availability of large-scale labeled datasets and advances in computing hardware (e.g., GPUs and TPUs), machine learning development focused heavily on model complexity. Breakthroughs in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models led to state-of-the-art results across multiple domains.

#### The Shift Toward Data-Centric AI

Despite significant advancements in model architecture, researchers encountered fundamental limitations that hindered further progress. One key challenge was the diminishing returns of model scaling. As models grew larger, their demand for data and computational resources increased exponentially, yet the improvements in performance were only marginal. This raised concerns about the long-term viability of scaling as the primary strategy for machine learning progress.

Additionally, issues related to data bias and generalization have become more apparent. Models trained on biased or unrepresentative datasets struggled to generalize to diverse real-world scenarios, leading to fairness concerns and unreliable outcomes.

Furthermore, robustness and reliability challenges have emerged. machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and inconsistencies in data, exposing the limitations of a purely model-centric approach. These vulnerabilities highlighted the need for strategies that went beyond architectural enhancements.

A crucial realization has emerged. machine learning performance was increasingly constrained not by the sophistication of model architectures but by the quality, diversity, and representativeness of the data used for training. This shift in perspective has laid the foundation for the emergence of Data-Centric AI, which prioritizes improving data quality to enhance model performance.

#### The Rise of Data-Centric AI

The transition to Data-Centric machine learning has been driven by the recognition that model performance is increasingly constrained by the quality, structure, and representativeness of the data used for training. As researchers encountered the limitations of model scaling, their focus shifted toward optimizing datasets—leading to a fundamental change in how machine learning systems are developed and refined.

Several factors have accelerated this shift. Advances in learning methods have demonstrated that machine learning can achieve strong performance with well-structured data, even when labeled examples are scarce. Improvements in data curation techniques have made it easier to systematically clean, augment, and manage datasets, reducing bias and enhancing generalization. Additionally, emerging data-generation approaches have broadened the scope of available training data, allowing for more diverse and privacy-preserving machine learning models.

A crucial insight has emerged from these developments: data is not merely an input to machine learning models—it is a fundamental driver of machine learning success. However, improving data is not a singular task. Data-Centric machine learning is composed of multiple interrelated components, each addressing a different aspect of how data is collected, processed, and leveraged for machine learning development.

#### Pillars of Data-centric AI

The shift toward Data-Centric machine learning is not a singular change but rather a structured approach that emphasizes different aspects of how data is collected, processed, and utilized in machine learning systems. To fully realize the benefits of this paradigm, we must consider five key pillars that define what it means to optimize data for machine learning development.

##### Data Quality & Curation

At the foundation of Data-Centric machine learning lies data quality—the degree to which a dataset is accurate, consistent, and well-structured. machine learning models rely on clean and well-labeled data to learn meaningful patterns, yet real-world datasets often contain errors, redundancies, and inconsistencies. Poor-quality data can mislead models, leading to biased or unreliable predictions.

To address this, data curation techniques such as data cleaning, deduplication, augmentation, and noise reduction play a crucial role. Systematically refining datasets ensures that machine learning models learn from accurate and representative information rather than being influenced by flawed or misleading data.

##### Data Efficiency

Optimizing machine learning models should not require more data—it should require better data. Data efficiency refers to the ability to maximize machine learning performance while minimizing data requirements. Large-scale data collection and annotation can be costly, time-consuming, and computationally intensive. Instead of relying on vast amounts of labeled data, machine learning can be trained more effectively through methods such as self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, and active learning.

By leveraging techniques that reduce the dependency on labeled data, machine learning systems become more accessible to organizations with limited resources. Data efficiency not only improves scalability but also reduces the environmental footprint of machine learning training by lowering computational demands.

##### Data Diversity & Representativeness

For machine learning models to generalize well to real-world applications, they must be trained on diverse and representative datasets. Bias in training data can lead to machine learning systems that perform well for certain demographics or scenarios while failing in others. This is particularly critical in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where fairness and inclusivity are paramount.

Ensuring diversity in data involves identifying and mitigating biases, improving class balance, and incorporating a broader range of perspectives and conditions. Without representative data, even the most advanced machine learning models risk reinforcing historical biases and making unreliable decisions when faced with unfamiliar inputs.

##### Data Privacy & Security

As machine learning systems increasingly rely on sensitive personal and proprietary data, ensuring privacy and security has become a fundamental pillar of Data-Centric AI. Traditional methods of centralized data collection pose risks related to data breaches, regulatory compliance, and user trust.

Emerging approaches such as federated learning, differential privacy, and synthetic data generation allow machine learning models to learn from data without directly exposing sensitive information. These privacy-preserving techniques ensure that machine learning systems can be both highly effective and ethically responsible, balancing performance with data protection.

##### Data Evaluation & Benchmarking

Improving data quality and efficiency is only meaningful if we have ways to measure these improvements. The evaluation of datasets plays a crucial role in Data-Centric AI, ensuring that data modifications lead to tangible benefits in machine learning performance.

Developing rigorous benchmarking techniques, dataset auditing frameworks, and error analysis tools allows researchers to systematically assess how well a dataset supports model learning. By establishing clear metrics for data quality and utility, machine learning practitioners can make informed decisions about dataset selection, refinement, and deployment.

##### Data Scalability

Data scalability refers to the capacity to accommodate increasing volumes of data while preserving efficiency, integrity, and practical usability within machine learning systems. As AI applications expand in complexity and scope, data collection, storage, and processing must scale accordingly. However, the effectiveness of a machine learning system is not solely determined by the quantity of data but also by the ability to manage this growth in a structured and sustainable manner.

A well-designed data infrastructure ensures that datasets remain relevant and useful as models evolve. Without scalability, increasing data volume can lead to diminishing returns, inefficiencies, and an unsustainable rise in computational and storage costs. Furthermore, data scalability must balance the need for comprehensive datasets with constraints such as annotation effort, retrieval efficiency, and system performance.

Incorporating scalability as a core principle of Data-Centric AI ensures that machine learning models can continue to improve while avoiding unnecessary resource consumption and operational inefficiencies. A scalable approach supports long-term AI development by facilitating efficient data management, maintaining dataset quality, and ensuring that data remains a valuable asset rather than a limiting factor.

#### Briding the Pillars Together

Each of these five pillars plays a distinct but interconnected role in Data-Centric AI. Some focus on improving the quality and diversity of data, ensuring machine learning models generalize better. Others, such as privacy and security, address ethical and regulatory concerns. However, one pillar stands out for its direct impact on the efficiency of machine learning training and deployment—Data Efficiency.

In contrast to other aspects of Data-Centric AI, which deal with improving dataset quality or mitigating bias, Data Efficiency is fundamentally about optimizing how machine learning systems consume and utilize data. As machine learning models grow in scale, the ability to maximize performance while minimizing data requirements becomes a crucial systems challenge. How can we train models faster? How can we reduce the computational burden of large-scale datasets? How can we make machine learning more accessible to those without massive data resources? These are the questions that Data Efficiency seeks to answer.

## Data Efficiency


### What is Data Efficiency

As machine learning systems continue to grow in scale, the traditional approach to improving performance has been to train models on ever-larger datasets, requiring extensive computational resources. However, this strategy has significant drawbacks. Collecting, labeling, and storing vast amounts of data is expensive and time-consuming. More importantly, simply increasing dataset size does not always translate to better performance. At a certain point, models experience diminishing returns, where additional data contributes little to improving accuracy or generalization.

Data Efficiency addresses this challenge by focusing on maximizing performance while minimizing the amount of data required. Instead of relying on ever-expanding datasets, data-efficient machine learning systems aim to extract the most value from limited, high-quality, and well-structured data. By improving how models utilize information, Data Efficiency reduces computational costs, enhances scalability, and makes machine learning more accessible.

This shift moves away from the mindset of "more data is always better" and instead emphasizes "better use of data leads to better outcomes." As machine learning continues to expand into new applications, developing more data-efficient approaches will be essential for ensuring that systems remain practical, cost-effective, and widely deployable.

A formal definition of Data Efficiency is given below. 

::: {.callout-note title="Definition of Data Efficiency"}

Instead of relying on large-scale datasets, data-efficient AI systems focus on extracting the most value from *limited, high-quality, and well-structured data*. By improving *how models utilize data*, Data Efficiency reduces *computational costs*, enhances *scalability*, and makes AI development more *accessible and sustainable*.

### Why Data Efficiency Matters in ML Systems

As machine learning systems continue to advance, the increasing demand for large datasets presents significant challenges in terms of cost, scalability, and sustainability. Traditional approaches rely on massive amounts of labeled data to improve model performance, but this method is becoming increasingly impractical. Data efficiency addresses these challenges by optimizing how machine learning systems utilize data, ensuring that models achieve high performance while minimizing resource consumption. This focus on efficiency is particularly important from a systems perspective, as it directly impacts the computational and operational feasibility of deploying machine learning at scale.  

#### Cost-Effectiveness and Resource Optimization

One of the main reasons data efficiency is important is the high cost associated with data collection, storage, and processing. Large-scale machine learning models require extensive datasets, often involving manual annotation, complex preprocessing pipelines, and substantial storage infrastructure. These costs can be prohibitive, particularly for smaller organizations, research institutions, and startups that lack the financial and computational resources of large technology companies. For example, OpenAI's GPT-3 model required hundreds of gigabytes of text data and significant computational resources, with estimates suggesting that training such models can cost millions of dollars. Similarly, the cost of annotating large datasets for tasks like image recognition can run into millions of dollars, as seen in projects like ImageNet. These examples highlight the financial burden of data collection and processing, underscoring the importance of data efficiency in making machine learning more accessible and sustainable.

From a systems perspective, storing and managing large datasets requires significant data engineering infrastructure investments, including high-capacity storage systems, distributed data processing frameworks, and scalable data pipelines. During training, excessive data volumes lead to higher memory footprints and increased data transfer, resulting in longer training times and greater computational costs. 

By focusing on data efficiency, machine learning systems can achieve comparable performance with smaller but more informative datasets, reducing the financial and computational burden associated with large-scale data pipelines.  

#### Environmental Sustainability and Computational Feasibility

Training modern machine learning models often requires high-performance computing clusters with specialized hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. These training processes consume large amounts of electricity, leading to increased carbon emissions and environmental impact. As models grow in size and require exponentially more data, their energy consumption also increases, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of current machine learning practices.  

A data-efficient approach mitigates this issue by reducing the amount of data required during training, thereby lowering computational demands. When models can achieve high accuracy with fewer training examples, the overall energy consumption per experiment decreases, making machine learning systems more computationally feasible and environmentally responsible. This is especially critical for organizations looking to deploy machine learning solutions at scale, as operational efficiency translates directly into lower infrastructure and energy costs.  

#### Accessibility and Democratization of Machine Learning

Beyond cost and sustainability, data efficiency plays an important role in making machine learning accessible to a broader range of organizations. While large technology companies can afford to collect and process massive datasets, many smaller organizations, academic researchers, and institutions in low-resource environments lack access to such large-scale data resources. Machine learning systems that require vast amounts of labeled data create a barrier to entry, limiting who can effectively develop and deploy these technologies.  

By reducing reliance on massive labeled datasets, data efficiency lowers the computational and data requirements needed to achieve strong model performance. This allows organizations with limited storage, computing power, or access to labeled data to develop effective machine learning solutions. Additionally, improved data efficiency facilitates on-device and edge computing applications, where models must operate efficiently with constrained resources. As machine learning becomes more embedded in mobile devices, IoT systems, and edge computing environments, the ability to achieve high performance with minimal data and compute resources becomes an essential systems-level consideration.  

#### The Systems Perspective: Data as a Bottleneck

Traditional efforts to improve efficiency in machine learning have focused on reducing model size and optimizing computation. However, as datasets continue to grow, data itself is emerging as a major bottleneck in the training pipeline. Data-intensive models require significant storage, high-bandwidth data transfers, and scalable preprocessing pipelines, all of which introduce latency and operational inefficiencies. Addressing these challenges requires a shift in focus from merely training better models to ensuring that data is used more effectively.  

By prioritizing data efficiency, machine learning practitioners can improve training times, reduce hardware requirements, and lower system-level inefficiencies. This shift has wide-ranging implications, from reducing cloud computing costs to enabling real-time learning in constrained environments. As machine learning continues to be deployed across a variety of industries, optimizing how data is used will be a crucial step toward making these systems scalable, sustainable, and accessible.

## Data Efficiency vs. Model Efficiency

As machine learning systems continue to scale, optimizing efficiency has become a major focus in both research and deployment. Traditionally, most efficiency improvements have come from model efficiency, which focuses on reducing computational costs by optimizing model architectures and improving inference speed. However, as datasets grow larger, the efficiency of data usage has become equally important. Data efficiency and model efficiency are two complementary approaches to improving machine learning systems, each targeting a different aspect of the overall computational pipeline.  

### Understanding model efficiency  

Model efficiency aims to make machine learning models faster, smaller, and more computationally efficient. This is achieved through methods that reduce the computational burden of training and inference, such as compressing models, pruning unnecessary parameters, and designing architectures that require fewer operations to produce accurate predictions. Model efficiency has been widely studied because reducing computation directly lowers the cost of training and deploying machine learning systems, making it possible to run models on lower-power devices, such as mobile phones, embedded systems, and edge computing platforms.  

One of the primary benefits of model efficiency is its impact on scalability. More efficient models require less memory and processing power, allowing them to be deployed in resource-constrained environments. This makes model efficiency particularly valuable for applications where real-time inference is required, such as autonomous systems, interactive applications, and on-device machine learning. However, optimizing models alone does not fully address the challenge of large-scale data requirements, which introduces its own inefficiencies.  

### How data efficiency differs  

While model efficiency focuses on reducing computational overhead by improving model structures, data efficiency aims to reduce the amount of data required for training and inference while maintaining or improving performance. Data efficiency addresses the increasing cost of data collection, storage, and processing by ensuring that machine learning models learn effectively from fewer, but more informative, examples. Instead of simply training models on larger datasets, data efficiency emphasizes strategies that make the most of existing data resources.  

One key advantage of data efficiency is its impact on training time and resource consumption. Large datasets require extensive computational infrastructure to store and process, increasing training times and energy consumption. By improving how data is selected, structured, and utilized, machine learning systems can reduce the need for extensive labeled datasets while still achieving strong performance. This shift is particularly important in scenarios where labeled data is scarce, expensive, or difficult to obtain, such as medical imaging, scientific research, and low-resource language processing.  

### Comparing model efficiency and data efficiency  

Both model efficiency and data efficiency play a crucial role in making machine learning systems scalable and sustainable, but they address different aspects of optimization. Model efficiency focuses on reducing computational costs by optimizing architectures and resource utilization, allowing machine learning models to run faster and with fewer hardware resources. Data efficiency, on the other hand, aims to minimize the volume of data required while ensuring high performance, reducing the need for extensive data collection and annotation.

While model efficiency enhances scalability by making inference more efficient, data efficiency improves accessibility by lowering the resource requirements associated with large-scale datasets. Model efficiency depends on refining model architectures and leveraging hardware optimizations, whereas data efficiency relies on improving data quality, diversity, and representativeness to maximize learning outcomes with fewer examples.

@tbl-model-vs-data-efficiency provides a comparison of these two approaches, highlighting their distinct roles in machine learning system design and the trade-offs involved in each optimization strategy.

### Why both matter  

Focusing only on model efficiency without considering data efficiency limits the overall impact of optimization efforts. While model efficiency allows machine learning systems to run faster and with fewer resources, it does not reduce the need for large-scale datasets, which continue to grow in size and complexity. Data efficiency, on the other hand, reduces the demand for data, but without model efficiency, training and inference may still require significant computational power.  

The most effective machine learning systems balance both model efficiency and data efficiency. By integrating strategies that improve both aspects, machine learning can become more computationally feasible, cost-effective, and accessible across a wider range of applications. In the next sections, we will explore the core components of data efficiency, identifying the key factors that influence how data can be used more effectively in machine learning development.  

## The Pillars of Data Efficiency

As machine learning systems grow in complexity, the efficiency with which they use data becomes a critical factor in their scalability, performance, and operational feasibility. Data efficiency is not a single concept but rather a combination of several interconnected factors that influence how effectively machine learning systems learn from data. These factors shape the way data is collected, processed, and utilized to maximize performance while minimizing computational and storage costs.

From a systems perspective, data efficiency is influenced by four key pillars: data quality, data quantity, data diversity, and data usability. Each of these plays a crucial role in ensuring that machine learning models are trained and deployed in a way that is both computationally effective and scalable.

### Data Quality: Ensuring reliable and useful inputs

Machine learning systems depend on high-quality data to learn meaningful patterns and make accurate predictions. Data quality refers to the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and reliability of the data used for training models. Poor-quality data can introduce inefficiencies at multiple stages of the machine learning pipeline, leading to longer training times, increased computational costs, and reduced model reliability.

One of the primary ways poor data quality impacts machine learning efficiency is by increasing training instability. If a dataset contains mislabeled examples, duplicate entries, or missing values, the learning process becomes less effective. Models may struggle to converge, requiring more iterations to reach optimal performance, which directly increases computational resource usage. Noisy data can also mislead models, forcing them to learn incorrect patterns, which ultimately degrades generalization and increases the need for retraining.

From a systems perspective, maintaining data quality presents several challenges. As datasets scale, manually identifying and correcting errors becomes impractical. Automated data validation pipelines are needed to detect inconsistencies, filter out redundant or corrupt samples, and ensure that the dataset remains reliable over time. Without these mechanisms, large-scale data ingestion can introduce significant inefficiencies, causing models to be trained on suboptimal data and leading to wasted computation.

Ensuring high data quality contributes directly to data efficiency. A well-curated dataset allows models to extract relevant information more effectively, reducing the total amount of data required for training. By eliminating low-value or misleading examples, machine learning systems can learn faster, require fewer computational resources, and achieve better performance with less data. Additionally, structured and validated datasets improve reproducibility, ensuring that training results remain consistent across different runs.

As machine learning systems continue to grow in scale, data quality will remain a critical factor in optimizing efficiency. However, even with high-quality data, another key question remains: how much data is actually needed for effective learning? 

### Data Quantity: Minimizing Excess While Maintaining Performance

The amount of data used in machine learning training has a direct impact on system efficiency. While larger datasets have traditionally been associated with better model performance, excessive data can introduce inefficiencies in terms of storage, computational cost, and training time. Optimizing data quantity is crucial for improving the efficiency of machine learning systems, ensuring that models achieve high accuracy while avoiding unnecessary overhead.

A key challenge in determining the right amount of data is identifying the minimum viable dataset size—the smallest dataset that allows a model to generalize effectively without sacrificing performance. If too little data is used, the model may underfit, failing to capture important patterns. However, beyond a certain point, adding more data provides diminishing returns, contributing little to performance while significantly increasing computational cost.

From a systems perspective, large datasets require more storage, memory, and bandwidth, which can create bottlenecks in training pipelines. Data ingestion, preprocessing, and augmentation all consume additional resources, leading to longer training cycles and increased energy consumption. When datasets contain redundant or low-value examples, these inefficiencies become even more pronounced. Removing redundant data and focusing on the most informative samples can lead to faster training times and lower resource utilization without negatively impacting model accuracy.

Strategies for optimizing data quantity include intelligent sampling techniques that prioritize informative or diverse examples while discarding redundant or unhelpful data. Some approaches aim to balance dataset size with model complexity, ensuring that training data is sufficient without overwhelming system resources. Reducing dataset size also benefits real-time and edge computing applications, where memory and processing power are limited.

By carefully managing data quantity, machine learning systems can achieve a balance between performance and efficiency, reducing the burden on computational infrastructure while maintaining strong generalization. However, even when the right amount of data is used, another critical factor remains: ensuring that the dataset is diverse and representative. The next section explores the role of data diversity in preventing biases and improving generalization in machine learning models.

### Data Diversity: Ensuring Representativeness and Reducing Bias

For machine learning systems to generalize effectively, the data they are trained on must be diverse and representative of the real-world conditions they are expected to encounter. Data diversity refers to the extent to which a dataset captures a broad range of variations across different attributes, scenarios, and subpopulations. A lack of diversity in training data can lead to biased models that perform well in some contexts but fail in others, reducing reliability and fairness.

From a systems perspective, poor data diversity introduces inefficiencies in both training and deployment. When a dataset lacks sufficient variation, a model may learn patterns that are overly specific to the training environment, leading to poor generalization. This can result in higher error rates in unseen scenarios, requiring additional retraining and domain adaptation, both of which increase computational costs. In safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving or medical diagnosis, failures due to insufficient data diversity can have significant real-world consequences.

Ensuring diversity in data is a computational and engineering challenge that requires scalable data collection and curation processes. Large-scale datasets must be evaluated for bias, balanced across key attributes, and supplemented with additional samples where necessary. Automated tools for detecting gaps in data distribution can help ensure that underrepresented cases are identified and addressed before training begins. In some cases, synthetic data generation techniques are used to augment datasets with rare or missing scenarios, helping improve robustness without requiring additional real-world data collection.

Data diversity is particularly important for edge and distributed machine learning systems, where models are deployed in varied environments and must adapt to different conditions. A model trained on a narrow dataset may struggle when deployed across diverse hardware, network conditions, or user behaviors. Ensuring diversity in training data can reduce the need for extensive fine-tuning, making machine learning systems more adaptable and efficient.

By prioritizing data diversity, machine learning systems can improve generalization, reduce bias, and minimize the need for retraining. However, even if data is high-quality, well-sized, and diverse, inefficiencies can still arise if it is not properly structured and managed. The next section explores data usability and how structuring data effectively contributes to system efficiency.

### Data Usability: Structuring Data for Efficient Processing

Even if data is high-quality, well-sized, and diverse, it can still introduce inefficiencies if it is not properly structured, organized, and managed. Data usability refers to how easily data can be accessed, processed, and reused within machine learning systems. Poor data usability can create bottlenecks in training pipelines, increase storage and retrieval costs, and reduce the efficiency of model development workflows.

A key challenge in data usability is the fragmentation of datasets across different formats, locations, and storage systems. Machine learning pipelines often rely on data from multiple sources, including structured databases, unstructured text, and streaming data. Without a well-defined strategy for integrating and preprocessing this data, systems can experience delays in data loading, inefficient memory usage, and inconsistencies between training and deployment environments. These inefficiencies slow down experimentation cycles and increase the computational cost of model development.

From a systems perspective, improving data usability involves standardizing storage formats, implementing efficient data retrieval mechanisms, and ensuring proper version control of datasets. Well-structured datasets allow machine learning models to be trained with minimal preprocessing overhead, reducing computational waste. Additionally, maintaining clear documentation and metadata about datasets helps ensure that models are trained on the correct versions of data, avoiding discrepancies that can lead to unreliable outcomes.

Data usability is particularly important in large-scale and collaborative machine learning environments. When teams share and reuse datasets, efficient data management practices help prevent duplication of effort and unnecessary recomputation. Systems that support dataset versioning, lineage tracking, and modular dataset construction enable researchers and engineers to iterate on models more efficiently, improving productivity while reducing storage and compute overhead.

By focusing on data usability, machine learning systems can streamline training workflows, reduce redundant computation, and improve overall efficiency. When data is well-organized and accessible, models can be trained faster, with fewer errors and lower operational costs. With a clear understanding of the core pillars of data efficiency—quality, quantity, diversity, and usability—the next step is to explore practical techniques and strategies that help optimize data efficiency in machine learning systems.

## Balancing the Pillars of Data Efficiency

Improving data efficiency in machine learning systems requires balancing the four key pillars: data quality, data quantity, data diversity, and data usability. While each of these factors contributes to making machine learning more effective and resource-efficient, they do not always align perfectly. Optimizing one pillar may introduce trade-offs in another, requiring careful consideration of how these elements interact. In practice, the ideal balance depends on the specific constraints and objectives of a given machine learning system. Some applications may prioritize reducing dataset size to minimize computational costs, while others may focus on improving data diversity to enhance model robustness. A critical approach to data efficiency involves understanding these trade-offs and making informed decisions about where to allocate resources for maximum impact.

### Trade-offs Between Data Quality, Quantity, Diversity, and Usability

While each of the four pillars contributes to data efficiency, they often interact in ways that require trade-offs. Improving one aspect may come at the cost of another, and optimizing data efficiency requires carefully navigating these tensions. Understanding these trade-offs helps machine learning practitioners make informed decisions about which aspects of data efficiency to prioritize in different scenarios.

One common trade-off exists between data quality and data quantity. Ensuring high-quality data often involves filtering out noisy, inconsistent, or mislabeled samples, but this can significantly reduce dataset size. While a smaller, cleaner dataset may lead to better model performance per sample, excessive filtering can remove valuable edge cases and reduce the model’s ability to generalize. On the other hand, collecting large amounts of data without proper quality control can lead to inefficient training and wasted computational resources. Striking the right balance involves determining how much data curation is necessary before the reduction in dataset size starts negatively impacting model learning.

Another key trade-off occurs between data diversity and data quantity. Increasing diversity often requires expanding the dataset to include underrepresented cases, edge scenarios, or rare events, which may introduce additional data collection and storage costs. However, improving diversity without substantially increasing dataset size requires intelligent sampling techniques, such as prioritizing unique or high-impact examples. If diversity is not considered, a model trained on a large dataset may still fail in real-world applications due to biased or incomplete coverage of the problem space.

Data usability also interacts with the other pillars, particularly in large-scale machine learning systems where storage, retrieval, and processing speeds are critical. Highly structured, well-managed datasets improve efficiency by reducing redundant computation and simplifying data access. However, excessive restructuring or aggressive deduplication can lead to a loss of valuable data points, particularly in cases where minor variations between samples contribute to learning robust representations. Usability improvements such as dataset versioning and metadata tracking also introduce additional infrastructure costs, which may not always be justifiable for short-term projects or rapidly evolving datasets.

Navigating these trade-offs requires a systematic approach. Instead of focusing solely on maximizing a single pillar, machine learning practitioners should evaluate their system’s constraints—such as computational resources, data availability, and deployment requirements—and determine where efficiency gains will have the greatest impact. In some cases, prioritizing better data quality may yield greater improvements in efficiency than simply increasing dataset size, while in others, ensuring diversity may be the key to avoiding costly retraining cycles. The next section provides a structured framework for making these decisions and aligning data efficiency strategies with system goals.

### A Framework for Balancing Data Efficiency

Optimizing data efficiency is not about improving all four pillars equally but rather about making strategic decisions based on system constraints, available resources, and intended use cases. Machine learning practitioners must assess the trade-offs between data quality, quantity, diversity, and usability to determine where optimization efforts will have the greatest impact. This section introduces a structured approach to decision-making when balancing these pillars in machine learning systems.

#### Step 1: Identify the Bottlenecks in the System
Before making any adjustments to improve data efficiency, the first step is diagnosing where inefficiencies exist in the machine learning pipeline. Simply collecting more data or refining data quality without understanding the root cause of inefficiencies can lead to unnecessary resource consumption without meaningful performance gains. Identifying bottlenecks ensures that optimization efforts are targeted and lead to measurable improvements.

One of the most common bottlenecks occurs when training times are excessively long. This can indicate an issue with data quantity or usability—for example, the dataset may contain redundant examples that provide little additional learning value but significantly increase computational costs. Similarly, if a dataset is stored inefficiently or requires extensive preprocessing before training, data usability improvements may be necessary.

Another common inefficiency arises when models fail to generalize well to unseen data. If a model performs well on training data but struggles on real-world test cases, the issue may stem from a lack of data diversity rather than insufficient dataset size. Expanding dataset size without addressing diversity issues often leads to diminishing returns, as the model continues to reinforce patterns that do not generalize well.

Poor data quality can also be a major bottleneck, particularly when inconsistent, noisy, or mislabeled data leads to unstable training dynamics. If a model frequently requires retraining due to performance degradation, it may be a sign that data cleaning and validation processes need improvement. Training on unreliable data not only leads to poor model performance but also increases computational overhead, as additional training cycles are required to correct for misleading patterns learned from poor-quality data.

Storage and retrieval inefficiencies represent another key bottleneck, particularly in large-scale machine learning systems. High storage costs, slow data retrieval speeds, or difficulty in tracking dataset versions can indicate problems with data usability. If accessing and preparing training data is a significant portion of overall training time, improving how datasets are structured and managed can lead to major efficiency gains.

By identifying these bottlenecks early, machine learning practitioners can focus their optimization efforts on the most impactful areas rather than applying broad, unfocused changes. Once the primary bottleneck is diagnosed, the next step is to determine which aspect of data efficiency—quality, quantity, diversity, or usability—should be prioritized to achieve the greatest efficiency improvements.

#### Step 2: Prioritize the Most Impactful Pillar

Once the primary bottleneck in the machine learning pipeline has been identified, the next step is determining which aspect of data efficiency—quality, quantity, diversity, or usability—should be prioritized for optimization. Since improving one pillar often comes with trade-offs in another, selecting the most impactful optimization ensures that resources are allocated efficiently and lead to meaningful improvements in system performance.

The choice of which pillar to prioritize depends on the specific inefficiencies affecting the system. When training times are excessively long, the issue often lies in either the volume of data being processed or inefficiencies in how data is retrieved and utilized. Large datasets with significant redundancy can slow down training without contributing meaningful performance improvements. In such cases, reducing dataset size through intelligent sampling or dataset pruning can improve efficiency without negatively impacting generalization. Similarly, if data retrieval and preprocessing introduce delays, restructuring data pipelines or reformatting storage systems can reduce the overhead associated with loading and preparing data for training.

If models fail to generalize well to new data, improving data diversity should take precedence. A dataset that lacks variation across important attributes can lead to models that perform well in controlled training environments but struggle in real-world applications. Simply increasing dataset size without addressing diversity gaps may not resolve these generalization issues, as the model may continue reinforcing patterns that are not representative of real-world conditions. Expanding the dataset with more diverse samples or ensuring balanced representation across different conditions can lead to better generalization while maintaining efficiency.

Frequent model retraining is often an indication of poor data quality. Noisy, inconsistent, or mislabeled data introduces instability in the learning process, making models more prone to overfitting to unreliable patterns. This, in turn, increases the need for frequent updates, leading to higher computational costs. In such cases, improving data quality through better cleaning, validation, and standardization can create more stable learning conditions, reducing the need for constant retraining cycles.

In large-scale machine learning systems, storage and retrieval inefficiencies can introduce significant overhead, particularly when datasets are poorly organized or difficult to version and track. If training workflows are slowed down due to difficulties in accessing and managing data, improving data usability should be the priority. Implementing structured storage formats, efficient indexing, and dataset versioning systems can streamline data access, reducing wasted time and improving overall pipeline efficiency.

Focusing on the most impactful pillar ensures that optimization efforts lead to meaningful improvements rather than unnecessary changes that may introduce new inefficiencies elsewhere. Instead of blindly increasing dataset size or investing in quality improvements without a clear need, this approach aligns optimizations with actual system constraints. Once the primary pillar for optimization has been selected, the next step is to evaluate potential trade-offs before implementing changes, ensuring that improvements in one area do not negatively affect another.

Making informed decisions about which pillar to optimize requires a structured approach. The flowchart shown in @fig-step2 provides a step-by-step framework for diagnosing bottlenecks in a machine learning system and selecting the most effective optimization strategy. By following this process, practitioners can ensure that efficiency improvements are targeted and impactful.

#### Step 3: Evaluate Trade-offs Before Implementing Changes

Once the most impactful pillar of data efficiency has been identified, the next step is to evaluate potential trade-offs before making changes. Optimizing one aspect of data efficiency can sometimes introduce unintended consequences in another, so it is important to assess how improvements in one area may affect the overall system. A careful evaluation of these trade-offs helps prevent new inefficiencies from emerging while ensuring that optimizations align with the broader goals of the machine learning system.

One of the most common trade-offs occurs between data quality and data quantity. Cleaning a dataset by removing noisy, inconsistent, or low-confidence samples can improve model stability and reduce computational overhead. However, excessive filtering may reduce the dataset’s overall size, potentially removing valuable edge cases that contribute to model generalization. Striking the right balance between quality and quantity requires determining how much data curation is necessary before the reduction in dataset size starts negatively affecting model performance. In cases where rare but important examples are removed, alternative strategies such as targeted data augmentation or weighting underrepresented samples may be needed to preserve diversity while maintaining data quality.

A similar trade-off exists between data diversity and dataset size. Expanding a dataset to improve representation across different conditions can enhance generalization, particularly when models are deployed in varied or unpredictable environments. However, increasing diversity without careful selection can significantly inflate dataset size, leading to longer training times and increased storage costs. Simply adding more data does not always result in better performance, particularly if the newly introduced samples do not provide meaningful variation. Ensuring that additional data meaningfully contributes to diversity—rather than merely increasing volume—can help mitigate unnecessary computational burden while still improving generalization.

Data usability also presents its own trade-offs, particularly in large-scale systems that require efficient storage and retrieval. Organizing datasets into structured formats, implementing indexing mechanisms, and maintaining version control can greatly enhance usability, making it easier to track dataset changes and reuse previous versions for training. However, these improvements often come with infrastructure costs, requiring additional computational resources for maintaining metadata, indexing, and managing distributed storage systems. If not implemented carefully, excessive restructuring can introduce overhead that negates the intended efficiency improvements. Deciding how much investment should be made in data usability depends on whether the time and resource savings from improved data access outweigh the costs of implementing and maintaining structured data management practices.

By critically evaluating these trade-offs before implementing changes, machine learning practitioners can avoid unintended inefficiencies and ensure that improvements are well-balanced across the system. Instead of making isolated adjustments, optimizations should be approached with a systems-level perspective, considering how changes in one area may influence computational costs, training efficiency, and model performance. Once trade-offs have been assessed and the optimization strategy has been refined, the next step is to implement changes while closely monitoring their impact to ensure that efficiency gains are realized.

Optimizing data efficiency requires understanding the trade-offs between different pillars. While improvements in one area can enhance model performance, reduce costs, or streamline workflows, they can also introduce new constraints that must be managed. @tbl-data-tradeoffs summarizes the impact of optimizing each pillar across key system considerations, helping practitioners anticipate potential challenges before implementing changes.

#### Step 4: Implement and Monitor Efficiency Gains

After evaluating the trade-offs involved in optimizing data efficiency, the next step is to implement the selected changes while closely monitoring their impact. Making adjustments to data quality, quantity, diversity, or usability should not be a one-time process but rather an iterative improvement cycle that is continuously assessed for effectiveness. Without proper monitoring, it is difficult to determine whether the optimizations have actually led to improvements or whether new inefficiencies have been introduced elsewhere in the system.

When reducing dataset size to improve efficiency, it is important to measure whether training times have actually decreased without negatively affecting model performance. If removing redundant or low-impact samples does not result in meaningful reductions in training time, then further refinements may be necessary. Similarly, if filtering out noisy or low-confidence data leads to a noticeable drop in generalization, adjustments may be needed to ensure that rare but informative examples are preserved. Monitoring changes in training time, memory usage, and model accuracy provides a clear picture of whether data quantity optimizations are yielding the intended benefits.

In cases where diversity improvements have been prioritized, tracking model performance across different subgroups and test conditions can reveal whether generalization has improved. If adding more diverse data does not result in increased robustness or fairness, it may indicate that the additional samples are not sufficiently different from existing ones or that the model architecture itself is limiting generalization. Evaluating model performance on edge cases and underrepresented scenarios helps determine whether diversity-focused optimizations are effective.

For data usability improvements, efficiency gains should be measured in terms of data retrieval speed, storage requirements, and ease of integration into machine learning workflows. If restructuring datasets and improving indexing systems lead to noticeable reductions in data access latency and preprocessing overhead, then the investment in usability improvements has paid off. However, if the added complexity of maintaining structured data formats or metadata tracking outweighs the time saved, adjustments may be necessary to strike a better balance.

Once changes have been implemented and initial performance metrics are collected, further refinements can be made based on real-world outcomes. Data efficiency is not a static goal but an ongoing optimization process that evolves with changing system requirements, new data sources, and advancements in machine learning techniques. By continuously monitoring and iterating on improvements, machine learning practitioners can ensure that efficiency gains are sustained over time and that models remain performant without excessive computational costs.

With a structured approach to implementing and monitoring efficiency gains, machine learning systems can become more scalable, cost-effective, and adaptable. The final step in the decision-making framework is to recognize that data efficiency is an evolving challenge and that periodic reassessment is necessary to keep systems optimized as data and deployment conditions change.

#### Step 5: Iterate and Adapt as the System Evolves

Data efficiency is not a one-time optimization but an ongoing process that must evolve alongside the machine learning system itself. As new data is collected, deployment conditions change, and system constraints shift, previously optimized data strategies may no longer be optimal. Without periodic reassessment, even well-designed data efficiency improvements can become outdated, leading to inefficiencies that counteract earlier gains. Maintaining an iterative approach ensures that machine learning systems continue to operate efficiently over time.

One reason continuous adaptation is necessary is that data distributions can shift. In real-world applications, the characteristics of incoming data often change due to external factors such as evolving user behavior, environmental variations, or updates to data collection processes. A dataset that was once diverse and representative may become biased or incomplete over time. If these changes are not detected and addressed, model performance may degrade, requiring updates to maintain accuracy. Regular evaluations of data diversity and representativeness help ensure that models remain robust even as deployment conditions shift.

Similarly, as machine learning models are updated and refined, the optimal balance between data quality, quantity, diversity, and usability may change. A newer model architecture may require less data to achieve similar performance, making previous data quantity optimizations less relevant. Likewise, advances in self-supervised learning or transfer learning may reduce dependency on large labeled datasets, shifting the emphasis toward improving data usability rather than increasing data collection efforts. Staying up to date with the latest machine learning developments allows practitioners to reassess data efficiency strategies in light of new capabilities.

Infrastructure constraints and computational resources also change over time, influencing the trade-offs between different pillars of data efficiency. As hardware accelerators become more powerful and cloud computing resources evolve, what was once a bottleneck in data retrieval or storage may no longer be a limiting factor. In contrast, growing datasets and larger-scale deployments may introduce new constraints that require renewed attention to dataset organization and storage efficiency. Evaluating system-level constraints on an ongoing basis ensures that optimization strategies remain aligned with the realities of the computing environment.

To keep machine learning systems operating efficiently, organizations should establish periodic reviews of data efficiency strategies, incorporating metrics that assess whether previous optimizations are still yielding benefits. Regular audits of data quality, dataset redundancy, and diversity distributions help identify areas where further improvements may be necessary. Automated monitoring tools can assist in detecting shifts in data patterns, enabling proactive adjustments before inefficiencies accumulate.

This process of continuous reassessment follows an iterative cycle, as shown in @fig-data-cont-cycle, ensuring that optimizations are sustained over time. As illustrated in the diagram below, machine learning practitioners must consistently identify bottlenecks, select a pillar to optimize, evaluate trade-offs, implement changes, and monitor results. When system conditions evolve, the process begins again, allowing data efficiency strategies to adapt to new challenges and opportunities.

By adopting an iterative mindset, machine learning practitioners can ensure that data efficiency remains an integral part of system design rather than a one-time effort. Continuous reassessment and adaptation allow models to stay performant while minimizing resource consumption, making machine learning systems more sustainable and cost-effective in the long run.

With a structured framework for balancing data efficiency across different pillars and a commitment to ongoing iteration, the next step is to explore specific techniques and strategies that can be applied to improve data efficiency in practice.

## Techniques and Strategies for Data Efficiency

Developing machine learning models with high accuracy and generalization capability often requires vast amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to obtain. However, not all data is equally valuable, and simply increasing dataset size does not always translate to better performance. Instead, optimizing the way data is utilized, structured, and curated is key to making machine learning systems more efficient.

Data efficiency can be improved through four fundamental strategies: minimizing labeling requirements, extracting more information from available data, reducing dataset size without compromising performance, and optimizing data utilization. Each of these strategies addresses a core challenge in achieving efficient data use, ensuring that machine learning systems remain scalable, cost-effective, and adaptable to real-world constraints.
