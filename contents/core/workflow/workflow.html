<p><em>What are the diverse elements of AI systems and how do we combine to create effective machine learning system solutions?</em></p>
<p>The creation of practical AI solutions requires the orchestration of multiple components into coherent workflows. Workflow design highlights the connections and interactions that animate these components. This systematic perspective reveals how data flow, model training, and deployment considerations are intertwined to form robust AI systems. Analyzing these interconnections offers important insights into system-level design choices, establishing a framework for understanding how theoretical concepts can be translated into deployable solutions that meet real-world needs.</p>

<p>The machine learning lifecycle is a systematic, interconnected process that guides the transformation of raw data into actionable models deployed in real-world applications. Each stage builds upon the outcomes of the previous one, creating an iterative cycle of refinement and improvement that supports robust, scalable, and reliable systems.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-ml-lifecycle" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.1</span></a> illustrates the lifecycle as a series of stages connected through continuous feedback loops. The process begins with data collection, which ensures a steady input of raw data from various sources. The collected data progresses to data ingestion, where it is prepared for downstream machine learning applications. Subsequently, data analysis and curation involve inspecting and selecting the most appropriate data for the task at hand. Following this, data labeling and data validation, which nowadays involves both humans and AI itself, ensure that the data is properly annotated and verified for usability before advancing further.</p>

<p>The data then enters the preparation stage, where it is transformed into machine learning-ready datasets through processes such as splitting and versioning. These datasets are used in the model training stage, where machine learning algorithms are applied to create predictive models. The resulting models are rigorously tested in the model evaluation stage, where performance metrics, such as key performance indicators (KPIs), are computed to assess reliability and effectiveness. The validated models move to the ML system validation phase, where they are verified for deployment readiness. Once validated, these models are integrated into production systems during the ML system deployment stage, ensuring alignment with operational requirements. The final stage tracks the performance of deployed systems in real time, enabling continuous adaptation to new data and evolving conditions.</p>
<p>This general lifecycle forms the backbone of machine learning systems, with each stage contributing to the creation, validation, and maintenance of scalable and efficient solutions. While the lifecycle provides a detailed view of the interconnected processes in machine learning systems, it can be distilled into a simplified framework for practical implementation.</p>
<p>Each stage aligns with one of the following overarching categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Collection and Preparation</strong> ensures the availability of high-quality, representative datasets.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Model Development and Training</strong> focuses on creating accurate and efficient models tailored to the problem at hand.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation and Validation</strong> rigorously tests models to ensure reliability and robustness in real-world conditions.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Deployment and Integration</strong> translates models into production-ready systems that align with operational realities.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Maintenance</strong> ensures ongoing system performance and adaptability in dynamic environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>A defining feature of this framework is its iterative and dynamic nature. Feedback loops, such as those derived from monitoring that guide data collection improvements or deployment adjustments, ensure that machine learning systems maintain effectiveness and relevance over time. This adaptability is critical for addressing challenges such as shifting data distributions, operational constraints, and evolving user requirements.</p>
<p>By studying this framework, we establish a solid foundation for exploring specialized topics such as data engineering, model optimization, and deployment strategies in subsequent chapters. Viewing the ML lifecycle as an integrated and iterative process promotes a deeper understanding of how systems are designed, implemented, and maintained over time. To that end, this chapter focuses on the machine learning lifecycle as a systems-level framework, providing a high-level overview that bridges theoretical concepts with practical implementation. Through an examination of the lifecycle in its entirety, we gain insight into the interdependencies among its stages and the iterative processes that ensure long-term system scalability and relevance.</p>

Definition of the ML Lifecycle
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The Machine Learning (ML) lifecycle is a structured, iterative process that defines the key stages required to develop, evaluate, and refine ML systems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The ML lifecycle emphasizes achieving specific objectives at each stage rather than prescribing rigid methodologies. This flexibility allows practitioners to adapt their approaches to the distinct challenges of individual projects. Typically, the lifecycle includes stages such as problem formulation, data acquisition and preprocessing, model development and training, evaluation, deployment, and continuous optimization.</p>
<p>While these stages generally progress sequentially, they are often revisited, creating a dynamic and interconnected process. This iterative approach fosters feedback loops, where lessons from later stages inform earlier ones. For example, insights gained during deployment might highlight deficiencies in data preparation or model design. Such adaptability requires a development approach that embraces flexibility and frequent iteration.</p>
<p>From a pedagogical perspective, the ML lifecycle provides a framework for breaking down the complexities of machine learning into manageable, interconnected components. Each stage, from problem formulation to iterative refinement, can be examined in depth, giving students a clear roadmap to understand and master the distinct subcomponents of machine learning systems. This structure mirrors real-world development while enabling a systematic exploration of the field’s core concepts.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the ML lifecycle and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), as these terms are often conflated. The ML lifecycle, as discussed in this chapter, focuses on the stages and evolution of ML systems—the “what” and “why” of development. MLOps, which will be explored in the <a href="../../../contents/core/ops/ops.html">MLOps Chapter</a>, addresses the “how,” including tools, practices, and automation that enable the efficient implementation of lifecycle stages. Beginning with the lifecycle establishes a conceptual foundation for later discussions of operational considerations.</p>

<p>Software development lifecycles have evolved through decades of engineering practice, establishing well-defined patterns for system development. Traditional lifecycles consist of sequential phases: requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Each phase produces specific artifacts that serve as inputs to subsequent phases. In financial software development, for instance, the requirements phase produces detailed specifications for transaction processing, security protocols, and regulatory compliance—specifications that directly translate into system behavior through explicit programming.</p>
<p>Machine learning systems require a fundamentally different approach to this traditional lifecycle model. The deterministic nature of conventional software, where behavior is explicitly programmed, contrasts sharply with the probabilistic nature of ML systems. Consider financial transaction processing: traditional systems follow predetermined rules (if account balance &gt; transaction amount, then allow transaction), while ML-based fraud detection systems learn to recognize suspicious patterns from historical transaction data. This shift from explicit programming to learned behavior fundamentally reshapes the development lifecycle.</p>
<p>The unique characteristics of machine learning systems—data dependency, probabilistic outputs, and evolving performance—introduce new dynamics that alter how lifecycle stages interact. These systems require ongoing refinement, with insights from later stages frequently feeding back into earlier ones. Unlike traditional systems, where lifecycle stages aim to produce stable outputs, machine learning systems are inherently dynamic and must adapt to changing data distributions and objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Problem Definition and Requirements:</strong> The first stage involves clearly defining the problem to be solved, establishing measurable performance objectives, and identifying key constraints. Precise problem definition ensures alignment between the system’s goals and the desired outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection and Preparation:</strong> This stage includes gathering relevant data, cleaning it, and preparing it for model training. This process often involves curating diverse datasets, ensuring high-quality labeling, and developing preprocessing pipelines to address variations in the data.</p>
<p><strong>Model Development and Training:</strong> In this stage, researchers select appropriate algorithms, design model architectures, and train models using the prepared data. Success depends on choosing techniques suited to the problem and iterating on the model design for optimal performance.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation and Validation:</strong> Evaluation involves rigorously testing the model’s performance against predefined metrics and validating its behavior in different scenarios. This stage ensures the model is not only accurate but also reliable and robust in real-world conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment and Integration:</strong> Once validated, the trained model is integrated into production systems and workflows. This stage requires addressing practical challenges such as system compatibility, scalability, and operational constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Maintenance:</strong> The final stage focuses on continuously monitoring the system’s performance in real-world environments and maintaining or updating it as necessary. Effective monitoring ensures the system remains relevant and accurate over time, adapting to changes in data, requirements, or external conditions.</p>
<p><strong>A Case Study in Medical AI</strong></p>
<p>To further ground our discussion on these stages, we will explore Google’s Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) screening project as a case study. This project exemplifies the transformative potential of machine learning in medical imaging analysis, an area where the synergy between algorithmic innovation and robust systems engineering plays a pivotal role. Building upon the foundational work by <span class="citation" data-cites="gulshan2016deep">Gulshan et al.

<p>On the surface, the goal appears straightforward: develop an AI system that could analyze retinal images and identify signs of DR with accuracy comparable to expert ophthalmologists. However, as the project progressed from research to real-world deployment, it revealed the complex challenges that characterize modern ML systems.</p>
<p>The initial results in controlled settings were promising. The system achieved performance comparable to expert ophthalmologists in detecting DR from high-quality retinal photographs. Yet, when the team attempted to deploy the system in rural clinics across Thailand and India, they encountered a series of challenges that spanned the entire ML lifecycle, from data collection through deployment and maintenance.</p>
<p>This case study will serve as a recurring thread throughout this chapter to illustrate how success in machine learning systems depends on more than just model accuracy. It requires careful orchestration of data pipelines, training infrastructure, deployment systems, and monitoring frameworks. Furthermore, the project highlights the iterative nature of ML system development, where real-world deployment often necessitates revisiting and refining earlier stages.</p>
<p>While this narrative is inspired by Google’s documented experiences in Thailand and India, certain aspects have been embellished to emphasize specific challenges frequently encountered in real-world healthcare ML deployments. These enhancements are to provide a richer understanding of the complexities involved while maintaining credibility and relevance to practical applications.</p>

<section id="problem-definition-and-requirements" class="level2" data-number="5.3">
<h2 data-number="5.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem-definition-and-requirements"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Problem Definition and Requirements</h2>
<p>The development of machine learning systems begins with a critical challenge that fundamentally differs from traditional software development: defining not just what the system should do, but how it should learn to do it. Unlike conventional software, where requirements directly translate into implementation rules, ML systems require teams to consider how the system will learn from data while operating within real-world constraints. This stage lays the foundation for all subsequent phases in the ML lifecycle.</p>
<p>In our case study, diabetic retinopathy (DR) represents a problem that blends technical complexity with global healthcare implications. With 415 million diabetic patients at risk of blindness worldwide and limited access to specialists in underserved regions, defining the problem required balancing technical goals—like expert-level diagnostic accuracy—with practical constraints. The system needed to prioritize cases for early intervention while operating effectively in resource-limited settings. These constraints showcased how problem definition must integrate learning capabilities with operational needs to deliver actionable and sustainable solutions.</p>
<section id="problem-requirements-and-system-impact" class="level3" data-number="5.3.1">
<h3 data-number="5.3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem-requirements-and-system-impact"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Problem Requirements and System Impact</h3>
<p>Defining an ML problem involves more than specifying desired performance metrics. It requires a deep understanding of the broader context in which the system will operate. For instance, developing a system to detect DR with expert-level accuracy might initially appear to be a straightforward classification task. After all, one might assume that training a model on a sufficiently large dataset of labeled retinal images and evaluating its performance against standard metrics would suffice.</p>
<p>However, real-world challenges complicate this picture. ML systems must function effectively in diverse environments, where factors like computational constraints, data variability, and integration requirements play significant roles. For example, the DR system needed to detect subtle features like microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and hard exudates across retinal images of varying quality while operating within the limitations of hardware in rural clinics. A model that performs well in isolation may falter if it cannot handle operational realities, such as inconsistent imaging conditions or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Addressing these factors requires aligning learning objectives with system constraints, ensuring the system’s long-term viability in its intended context.</p>

<section id="problem-definition-workflow" class="level3" data-number="5.3.2">
<h3 data-number="5.3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem-definition-workflow"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Problem Definition Workflow</h3>
<p>Establishing clear and actionable problem definitions involves a multi-step workflow that bridges technical, operational, and user considerations. The process begins with identifying the core objective of the system—what tasks it must perform and what constraints it must satisfy. Teams collaborate with stakeholders to gather domain knowledge, outline requirements, and anticipate challenges that may arise in real-world deployment.</p>
<p>In the DR project, this phase involved close collaboration with clinicians to determine the diagnostic needs of rural clinics. Key decisions, such as balancing model complexity with hardware limitations and ensuring interpretability for healthcare providers, were made during this phase. The team’s iterative approach also accounted for regulatory considerations, such as patient privacy and compliance with healthcare standards. This collaborative process ensured that the problem definition aligned with both technical feasibility and clinical relevance.</p>

<section id="scale-and-distribution-challenges" class="level3" data-number="5.3.3">
<h3 data-number="5.3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scale-and-distribution-challenges"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.3</span> Scale and Distribution Challenges</h3>
<p>As ML systems scale, their problem definitions must adapt to new operational challenges. For example, the DR project initially focused on a limited number of clinics with consistent imaging setups. However, as the system expanded to include clinics with varying equipment, staff expertise, and patient demographics, the original problem definition required adjustments to accommodate these variations.</p>
<p>Scaling also introduces data challenges. Larger datasets may include more diverse edge cases, which can expose weaknesses in the initial model design. In the DR project, for instance, expanding the deployment to new regions introduced variations in imaging equipment and patient populations that required further tuning of the system. Defining a problem that accommodates such diversity from the outset ensures the system can handle future expansion without requiring a complete redesign.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="systems-thinking"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.4</span> Systems Thinking</h3>
<p>Problem definition, viewed through a systems lens, connects deeply with every stage of the ML lifecycle. Choices made during this phase shape how data is collected, how models are developed, and how systems are deployed and maintained. A poorly defined problem can lead to inefficiencies or failures in later stages, emphasizing the need for a holistic perspective.</p>
<p>Feedback loops are central to effective problem definition. As the system evolves, real-world feedback from deployment and monitoring often reveals new constraints or requirements that necessitate revisiting the problem definition. For example, feedback from clinicians about system usability or patient outcomes may guide refinements in the original goals. In the DR project, the need for interpretable outputs that clinicians could trust and act upon influenced both model development and deployment strategies.</p>
<p>Emergent behaviors also play a role. A system that was initially designed to detect retinopathy might reveal additional use cases, such as identifying other conditions like diabetic macular edema, which can reshape the problem’s scope and requirements. In the DR project, insights from deployment highlighted potential extensions to other imaging modalities, such as 3D Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).</p>
<p>Resource dependencies further highlight the interconnectedness of problem definition. Decisions about model complexity, for instance, directly affect infrastructure needs, data collection strategies, and deployment feasibility. Balancing these dependencies requires careful planning during the problem definition phase, ensuring that early decisions do not create bottlenecks in later stages.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.3.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lifecycle-implications"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.5</span> Lifecycle Implications</h3>
<p>The problem definition phase is foundational, influencing every subsequent stage of the lifecycle. A well-defined problem ensures that data collection focuses on the most relevant features, that models are developed with the right constraints in mind, and that deployment strategies align with operational realities.</p>
<p>In the DR project, defining the problem with scalability and adaptability in mind enabled the team to anticipate future challenges, such as accommodating new imaging devices or expanding to additional clinics. For instance, early considerations of diverse imaging conditions and patient demographics reduced the need for costly redesigns later in the lifecycle. This forward-thinking approach ensured the system’s long-term success and adaptability in dynamic healthcare environments.</p>
<p>By embedding lifecycle thinking into problem definition, teams can create systems that not only meet initial requirements but also adapt and evolve in response to changing conditions. This ensures that ML systems remain effective, scalable, and impactful over time.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-collection-and-preparation"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Data Collection and Preparation</h2>
<p>Data is the foundation of machine learning systems, yet collecting and preparing data for ML applications introduces challenges that extend far beyond gathering enough training examples. Modern ML systems often need to handle terabytes of data—ranging from raw, unstructured inputs to carefully annotated datasets—while maintaining quality, diversity, and relevance for model training. For medical systems like DR screening, data preparation must meet the highest standards to ensure diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p>In the DR project, data collection involved a development dataset of 128,000 retinal fundus photographs evaluated by a panel of 54 ophthalmologists, with each image reviewed by 3-7 experts. This collaborative effort ensured high-quality labels that captured clinically relevant features like microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and hard exudates. Additionally, clinical validation datasets comprising 12,000 images provided an independent benchmark to test the model’s robustness against real-world variability, illustrating the importance of rigorous and representative data collection. The scale and complexity of this effort highlight how domain expertise and interdisciplinary collaboration are critical to building datasets for high-stakes ML systems.</p>
<section id="data-requirements-and-system-impact" class="level3" data-number="5.4.1">
<h3 data-number="5.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-requirements-and-system-impact"><span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> Data Requirements and System Impact</h3>
<p>The requirements for data collection and preparation emerge from the dual perspectives of machine learning and operational constraints. In the DR project, high-quality retinal images annotated by experts were a foundational need to train accurate models. However, real-world conditions quickly revealed additional complexities. Images were collected from rural clinics using different camera equipment, operated by staff with varying levels of expertise, and often under conditions of limited network connectivity.</p>
<p>These operational realities shaped the system architecture in significant ways. The volume and size of high-resolution images necessitated local storage and preprocessing capabilities at clinics, as centralizing all data collection was impractical due to unreliable internet access. Furthermore, patient privacy regulations required secure data handling at every stage, from image capture to model training. Coordinating expert annotations also introduced logistical challenges, necessitating systems that could bridge the physical distance between clinics and ophthalmologists while maintaining workflow efficiency.</p>
<p>These considerations demonstrate how data collection requirements influence the entire ML lifecycle. Infrastructure design, annotation pipelines, and privacy protocols all play critical roles in ensuring that collected data aligns with both technical and operational goals.</p>

<section id="data-flow-and-infrastructure" class="level3" data-number="5.4.2">
<h3 data-number="5.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-flow-and-infrastructure"><span class="header-section-number">5.4.2</span> Data Flow and Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The flow of data through the system highlights critical infrastructure requirements at every stage. In the DR project, the journey of a single retinal image offers a glimpse into these complexities. From its capture on a retinal camera, where image quality is paramount, the data moves through local clinic systems for initial storage and preprocessing. Eventually, it must reach central systems where it is aggregated with data from other clinics for model training and validation.</p>
<p>At each step, the system must balance local needs with centralized aggregation requirements. Clinics with reliable high-speed internet could transmit data in real-time, but many rural locations relied on store-and-forward systems, where data was queued locally and transmitted in bulk when connectivity permitted. These differences necessitated flexible infrastructure that could adapt to varying conditions while maintaining data consistency and integrity across the lifecycle. This adaptability ensured that the system could function reliably despite the diverse operational environments of the clinics.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scale-and-distribution-challenges-1"><span class="header-section-number">5.4.3</span> Scale and Distribution Challenges</h3>
<p>As ML systems scale, the challenges of data collection grow exponentially. In the DR project, scaling from an initial few clinics to a broader network introduced significant variability in equipment, workflows, and operating conditions. Each clinic effectively became an independent data node, yet the system needed to ensure consistent performance and reliability across all locations.</p>
<p>This scaling effort also brought increasing data volumes, as higher-resolution imaging devices became standard, generating larger and more detailed images. These advances amplified the demands on storage and processing infrastructure, requiring optimizations to maintain efficiency without compromising quality. Differences in patient demographics, clinic workflows, and connectivity patterns further underscored the need for robust design to handle these variations gracefully.</p>
<p>Scaling challenges highlight how decisions made during the data collection phase ripple through the lifecycle, impacting subsequent stages like model development, deployment, and monitoring. For instance, accommodating higher-resolution data during collection directly influences computational requirements for training and inference, emphasizing the need for lifecycle thinking even at this early stage.</p>

<p>Quality assurance is an integral part of the data collection process, ensuring that data meets the requirements for downstream stages. In the DR project, automated checks at the point of collection flagged issues like poor focus or incorrect framing, allowing clinic staff to address problems immediately. These proactive measures ensured that low-quality data was not propagated through the pipeline.</p>
<p>Validation systems extended these efforts by verifying not just image quality but also proper labeling, patient association, and compliance with privacy regulations. Operating at both local and centralized levels, these systems ensured data reliability and robustness, safeguarding the integrity of the entire ML pipeline.</p>

<p>Viewing data collection and preparation through a lifecycle lens reveals the interconnected nature of these processes. Each decision made during this phase influences subsequent stages of the ML system. For instance, choices about camera equipment and image preprocessing affect not only the quality of the training dataset but also the computational requirements for model development and the accuracy of predictions during deployment.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-ml-lifecycle-feedback" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.4</span></a> illustrates the key feedback loops that characterize the ML lifecycle, with particular relevance to data collection and preparation. Looking at the left side of the diagram, we see how monitoring and maintenance activities feed back to both data collection and preparation stages. For example, when monitoring reveals data quality issues in production (shown by the “Data Quality Issues” feedback arrow), this triggers refinements in our data preparation pipelines. Similarly, performance insights from deployment might highlight gaps in our training data distribution (indicated by the “Performance Insights” loop back to data collection), prompting the collection of additional data to cover underrepresented cases. In the DR project, this manifested when monitoring revealed that certain demographic groups were underrepresented in the training data, leading to targeted data collection efforts to improve model fairness and accuracy across all populations.</p>

<p>Feedback loops are another critical aspect of this lifecycle perspective. Insights from model performance often lead to adjustments in data collection strategies, creating an iterative improvement process. For example, in the DR project, patterns observed during model evaluation influenced updates to preprocessing pipelines, ensuring that new data aligned with the system’s evolving requirements.</p>
<p>The scaling of data collection introduces emergent behaviors that must be managed holistically. While individual clinics may function well in isolation, the simultaneous operation of multiple clinics can lead to system-wide patterns like network congestion or storage bottlenecks. These behaviors reinforce the importance of considering data collection as a system-level challenge rather than a discrete, isolated task.</p>
<p>In the following chapters, we will step through each of the major stages of the lifecycle shown in <a href="#fig-ml-lifecycle-feedback" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.4</span></a>. We will consider several key questions like what influences data source selection, how feedback loops can be systematically incorporated, and how emergent behaviors can be anticipated and managed holistically.</p>
<p>In addition, by adopting a systems thinking approach, we emphasize the iterative and interconnected nature of the ML lifecycle. How do choices in data collection and preparation ripple through the entire pipeline? What mechanisms ensure that monitoring insights and performance evaluations effectively inform improvements at earlier stages? And how can governance frameworks and infrastructure design evolve to meet the challenges of scaling while maintaining fairness and efficiency? These questions will guide our exploration of the lifecycle, offering a foundation for designing robust and adaptive ML systems.</p>

<p>The success of ML systems depends on how effectively data collection integrates with the entire lifecycle. Decisions made in this stage affect not only the quality of the initial model but also the system’s ability to evolve and adapt. For instance, data distribution shifts or changes in imaging equipment over time require the system to handle new inputs without compromising performance.</p>
<p>In the DR project, embedding lifecycle thinking into data management strategies ensured the system remained robust and scalable as it expanded to new clinics and regions. By proactively addressing variability and quality during data collection, the team minimized the need for costly downstream adjustments, aligning the system with long-term goals and operational realities.</p>

Future challenges in AI development—be they in healthcare, finance, environmental science, or any other field—will likely center around managing increased complexity, ensuring adaptability, and balancing performance with ethical considerations. By approaching AI development with a systems-oriented mindset, we can create solutions that are not only technically proficient but also robust, adaptable, and aligned with real-world needs across a wide spectrum of applications.</p>
