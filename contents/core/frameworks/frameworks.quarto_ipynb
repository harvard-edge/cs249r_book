They provide efficient implementations of mathematical operations, automatic differentiation capabilities, and tools for managing model development, hardware acceleration, and memory utilization. For production systems, they offer standardized approaches to model deployment, versioning, and optimization. However, due to their diversity, there is no universally agreed-upon definition of an ML framework. To establish clarity for this chapter, we adopt the following definition:\n",

Machine learning computations are primarily matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplications. The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms ([BLAS](https://www.netlib.org/blas/)), developed in 1979, provided these essential matrix operations that would become the computational backbone of machine learning [@kung1979systolic]. These low-level operations, when combined and executed efficiently, enable the complex calculations required for training neural networks and other ML models.\n",

        "Building upon BLAS, the Linear Algebra Package ([LAPACK](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/)) emerged in 1992, extending these capabilities with more sophisticated linear algebra operations such as matrix decompositions, eigenvalue problems, and linear system solutions. This layered approach of building increasingly complex operations from fundamental matrix computations became a defining characteristic of ML frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The development of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) in 2006 marked an important milestone in this evolution, building upon its predecessors Numeric and Numarray to become the fundamental package for numerical computation in Python. NumPy introduced n-dimensional array objects and essential mathematical functions, but more importantly, it provided an efficient interface to these underlying BLAS and LAPACK operations. This abstraction allowed developers to work with high-level array operations while maintaining the performance of optimized low-level matrix computations.\n",

        "In 2001, [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) emerged as a powerful extension built on top of NumPy, adding specialized functions for optimization, linear algebra, and signal processing. This further exemplified the pattern of progressive abstraction in ML frameworks: from basic matrix operations to sophisticated numerical computations, and eventually to high-level machine learning algorithms. This layered architecture, starting from fundamental matrix operations and building upward, would become a blueprint for future ML frameworks, as we will see in this chapter.\n",

While the underlying computations remained rooted in matrix operations, frameworks began to encapsulate these operations into higher-level machine learning primitives. The University of Waikato introduced Weka in 1993 [@witten2002data], one of the earliest ML frameworks, which abstracted matrix operations into data mining tasks, though it was limited by its Java implementation and focus on smaller-scale computations.\n",

        "[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), emerging in 2007, was a significant advancement in this abstraction. Building upon the NumPy and SciPy foundation, it transformed basic matrix operations into intuitive ML algorithms. For example, what was fundamentally a series of matrix multiplications and gradient computations became a simple `fit()` method call in a logistic regression model. This abstraction pattern - hiding complex matrix operations behind clean APIs - would become a defining characteristic of modern ML frameworks.\n",

Computational graphs represented mathematical operations as directed graphs, with matrix operations as nodes and data flowing between them. This graph-based approach allowed for automatic differentiation and optimization of the underlying matrix operations. More importantly, it enabled the framework to automatically route these operations to GPU hardware, dramatically accelerating matrix computations.\n",

Torch's design philosophy of prioritizing developer experience while maintaining high performance influenced many subsequent frameworks. Its architecture demonstrated how to balance high-level abstractions with efficient low-level matrix operations, establishing design patterns that would later influence frameworks like PyTorch.\n",

        "Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), introduced in 2015, revolutionized the field by treating matrix operations as part of a distributed computing problem [@dean2012large]. It represented all computations, from individual matrix multiplications to entire neural networks, as a static computational graph that could be split across multiple devices. This approach enabled training of unprecedented model sizes by distributing matrix operations across clusters of computers and specialized hardware. TensorFlow's static graph approach, while initially constraining, allowed for aggressive optimization of matrix operations through techniques like kernel fusion (combining multiple operations into a single kernel for efficiency) and memory planning (pre-allocating memory for operations).\n",

        "Facebook's [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), also launched in 2016, took a radically different approach to handling matrix computations. Instead of static graphs, PyTorch introduced dynamic computational graphs that could be modified on the fly [@paszke2019pytorch]. This dynamic approach, while potentially sacrificing some optimization opportunities, made it much easier for researchers to debug and understand the flow of matrix operations in their models. PyTorch's success demonstrated that the ability to introspect and modify computations dynamically was as important as raw performance for many applications.\n",

        "This forward propagation of derivative information happens automatically within the framework's computational machinery. The framework: 1. Enriches each value with derivative information 2. Transforms each basic operation to handle both value and derivative 3. Propagates this information forward through the computation\n",
        "\n",
        "The beauty of this approach is that it follows the natural flow of computation - as values move forward through the program, their derivatives move with them. This makes forward mode particularly well-suited for functions with single inputs and multiple outputs, as the derivative information follows the same path as the regular computation.\n",

        "\n",
        "Forward mode AD exhibits distinct performance patterns that influence when and how frameworks employ it. Understanding these characteristics helps explain why frameworks choose different AD approaches for different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "Forward mode performs one derivative computation alongside each original operation. For a function with one input variable, this means roughly doubling the computational work - once for the value, once for the derivative. The cost scales linearly with the number of operations in the program, making it predictable and manageable for simple computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, consider a neural network layer computing derivatives for matrix multiplication between weights and inputs. To compute derivatives with respect to all weights, forward mode would need to perform the computation once for each weight parameter - potentially thousands of times. This reveals an important characteristic: forward mode's efficiency depends on the number of input variables we need derivatives for.\n",
        "\n",
        "Forward mode's memory requirements are relatively modest. It needs to store the original value, a single derivative value, and temporary results during computation. The memory usage stays constant regardless of how complex the computation becomes. This predictable memory pattern makes forward mode particularly suitable for embedded systems with limited memory, real-time applications requiring consistent memory use, and systems where memory bandwidth is a bottleneck.\n",
        "\n",
        "This combination of computational scaling with input variables but constant memory usage creates specific trade-offs that influence framework design decisions. Forward mode shines in scenarios with few inputs but many outputs, where its straightforward implementation and predictable resource usage outweigh the computational cost of multiple passes.\n",

It allows the framework to see the entire computation ahead of time, enabling global optimizations that can improve performance, especially for complex models.

Large models require significant computational power and memory, while massive datasets demand efficient processing across multiple machines. To address these challenges, modern AI frameworks provide built-in support for distributed execution, allowing computations to be split across multiple GPUs, TPUs, or distributed clusters. By abstracting the complexities of parallel execution, these frameworks enable practitioners to scale machine learning workloads efficiently while maintaining ease of use.\n",

Data parallelism allows multiple devices to train the same model on different subsets of data, ensuring faster convergence without increasing memory requirements. Model parallelism, on the other hand, partitions the model itself across multiple devices, allowing the training of architectures too large to fit into a single device’s memory. While model parallelism comes in several variations, which will be explored in later chapters, both techniques are essential for training modern machine learning models efficiently.\n",

Once the computations are complete, the gradients computed on each device are synchronized before updating the model parameters, ensuring consistency across all copies.

TensorFlow’s `TPUStrategy` allows for automatic partitioning of large models across TPU cores, optimizing execution for high-speed interconnects. Additionally, frameworks like DeepSpeed and Megatron-LM extend PyTorch by implementing advanced model sharding techniques, including tensor parallelism, which splits model weights across multiple devices to reduce memory overhead.\n",

Cloud ML frameworks are optimized to work with datasets and models that far exceed the capacity of single machines. This specialization is reflected in the data structures of these frameworks. For instance, both TensorFlow and PyTorch use mutable Tensor objects as their primary data structure, allowing for efficient in-place operations on large datasets. JAX, a more recent framework, uses immutable arrays, which can provide benefits in terms of functional programming paradigms and optimization opportunities in distributed settings.\n",
