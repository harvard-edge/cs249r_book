            "answer": "Transformers rely on random access patterns due to attention mechanisms, requiring large caches and sophisticated prefetching strategies to handle unpredictable memory accesses. In contrast, CNNs use more predictable strided access patterns, allowing for efficient caching and data reuse. This difference necessitates different memory hierarchies and optimizations in system design.",
