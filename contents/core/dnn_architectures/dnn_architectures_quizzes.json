            "answer": "Supporting dense matrix operations requires hardware optimized for parallel processing, like tensor cores, while dynamic computations demand flexibility for runtime decisions. Balancing these needs involves trade-offs in hardware design, such as choosing between fixed-function units for efficiency and general-purpose units for flexibility, impacting performance and energy efficiency.",
