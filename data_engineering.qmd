# Data Engineering

## Introduction
Data is the lifeblood of AI systems. Without good data, even the most advanced machine learning algorithms will fail. In this section, we will dive into the intricacies of building high-quality datasets to fuel our AI models. Data engineering encompasses the processes of collecting, storing, processing, and managing data for training machine learning models.

Dataset creators face complex privacy and representation challenges when building high-quality training data, especially for sensitive domains like healthcare. Legally, creators may need to remove direct identifiers like names and ages. Even without legal obligations, removing such information can help build user trust. However, excessive anonymization can compromise dataset utility. Techniques like differential privacy$^{1}$, aggregation, and reducing detail provide alternatives to balance privacy and utility, but have downsides. Creators must strike a thoughtful balance based on use case.

Looking beyond privacy, creators need to proactively assess and address representation gaps that could introduce model biases.[^2] It is crucial yet insufficient to ensure diversity across individual variables like gender, race, and accent. Combinations of characteristics also require assessment, as models can struggle when certain intersections are absent. For example, a medical dataset could have balanced gender, age, and diagnosis data individually, but lack enough cases capturing elderly women with a specific condition. Such [higher-order gaps](https://blog.google/technology/health/healthcare-ai-systems-put-people-center/) are not immediately obvious but can critically impact model performance.

Creating useful, ethical training data requires holistic consideration of privacy risks and representation gaps. Perfect solutions are elusive. However, conscientious data engineering practices like anonymization, aggregation, undersampling overrepresented groups, and synthesized data generation can help balance competing needs. This facilitates models that are both accurate and socially responsible. Cross-functional collaboration and external audits can also strengthen training data. The challenges are multifaceted, but surmountable with thoughtful effort.

We begin by discussing data collection: Where do we source data, and how do we gather it? Options range from scraping the web, accessing APIs, utilizing sensors and IoT devices, to conducting surveys and gathering user input. These methods reflect real-world practices. Next, we delve into data labeling, including considerations for human involvement. We’ll discuss the trade-offs and limitations of human labeling and explore emerging methods for automated labeling. Following that, we’ll address data cleaning and preprocessing, a crucial yet frequently undervalued step in preparing raw data for AI model training. Data augmentation comes next, a strategy for enhancing limited datasets by generating synthetic samples. This is particularly pertinent for embedded systems, as many use cases don’t have extensive data repositories readily available for curation. Synthetic data generation emerges as a viable alternative, though it comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. We’ll also touch upon dataset versioning, emphasizing the importance of tracking data modifications over time. Data is ever-evolving; hence, it’s imperative to devise strategies for managing and storing expansive datasets. By the end of this section, you’ll possess a comprehensive understanding of the entire data pipeline, from collection to storage, essential for operationalizing AI systems. Let’s embark on this journey!




## Problem Definition
In many domains of machine learning, while sophisticated algorithms take center stage, the fundamental importance of data quality is often overlooked. This neglect gives rise to [“Data Cascades”](https://research.google/pubs/pub49953/) — events where lapses in data quality compound, leading to negative downstream consequences such as flawed predictions, project terminations, and even potential harm to communities.

![A visual representation of the stages in the machine learning pipeline and the potential pitfalls, illustrating how data quality lapses can lead to cascading negative consequences throughout the process.](images/data_engineering_cascades.png)

Despite many ML professionals recognizing the importance of data, numerous practitioners report facing these cascades. This highlights a systemic issue: while the allure of developing advanced models remains, data is often underappreciated.

Take, for example, Keyword Spotting (KWS). KWS serves as a prime example of TinyML in action and is a critical technology behind voice-enabled interfaces on endpoint devices such as smartphones. Typically functioning as lightweight wake-word engines, these systems are consistently active, listening for a specific phrase to trigger further actions. When we say the phrases “Ok Google” or “Alexa,” this initiates a process on a microcontroller embedded within the device. Despite their limited resources, these microcontrollers play a pivotal role in enabling seamless voice interactions with devices, often operating in environments with high levels of ambient noise. The uniqueness of the wake-word helps minimize false positives, ensuring that the system is not triggered inadvertently.

It is important to appreciate that these keyword spotting technologies are not isolated; they integrate seamlessly into larger systems, processing signals continuously while managing low power consumption. These systems extend beyond simple keyword recognition, evolving to facilitate diverse sound detections, such as the breaking of glass. This evolution is geared towards creating intelligent devices capable of understanding and responding to a myriad of vocal commands, heralding a future where even household appliances can be controlled through voice interactions.

![The seamless integration of Keyword Spotting technology allows users to command their devices with simple voice prompts, even in ambient noise environments](images/data_engineering_kws.png)

Building a reliable KWS model is not a straightforward task. It demands a deep understanding of the deployment scenario, encompassing where and how these devices will operate. For instance, a KWS model's effectiveness is not just about recognizing a word; it's about discerning it among various accents and background noises, whether in a bustling cafe or amid the blaring sound of a television in a living room or a kitchen where these devices are commonly found. It's about ensuring that a whispered "Alexa" in the dead of night or a shouted "Ok Google" in a noisy marketplace are both recognized with equal precision.

Moreover, many of the current KWS voice assistants support a limited number of languages, leaving a substantial portion of the world’s linguistic diversity unrepresented. This limitation is partly due to the difficulty in gathering and monetizing data for languages spoken by smaller populations. The long-tail distribution of languages implies that many languages have limited data available, making the development of supportive technologies challenging.

This level of accuracy and robustness hinges on the availability of data, quality of data, ability to label the data correctly, and ensuring transparency of the data for the end user—all before the data is used to train the model. But it all begins with a clear understanding of the problem statement or definition.


Generally, in ML, problem definition has a few key steps:

1. Identifying the problem definition clearly

2. Setting clear objectives

3. Establishing success benchmark

4. Understanding end-user engagement/use

5. Understanding the constraints and limitations of deployment

6. Followed by finally doing the data collection.


Laying a solid foundation for a project is essential for its trajectory and eventual success. Central to this foundation is first identifying a clear problem, such as ensuring that voice commands in voice assistance systems are recognized consistently across varying environments. Clear objectives, like creating representative datasets for diverse scenarios, provide a unified direction. Benchmarks, such as system accuracy in keyword detection, offer measurable outcomes to gauge progress. Engaging with stakeholders, from end-users to investors, provides invaluable insights and ensures alignment with market needs. Additionally, when delving into areas like voice assistance, understanding platform constraints is pivotal. Embedded systems, such as microcontrollers, come with inherent limitations in processing power, memory, and energy efficiency. Recognizing these limitations ensures that functionalities, like keyword detection, are tailored to operate optimally, balancing performance with resource conservation.

In this context, using KWS as an example, we can break each of the steps out as follows:

1. **Identifying the Problem:**
   At its core, KWS aims to detect specific keywords amidst a sea of ambient sounds and other spoken words. The primary problem is to design a system that can recognize these keywords with high accuracy, low latency, and minimal false positives or negatives, especially when deployed on devices with limited computational resources.

2. **Setting Clear Objectives:**
   The objectives for a KWS system might include:
   - Achieving a specific accuracy rate (e.g., 98% accuracy in keyword detection).
   - Ensuring low latency (e.g., keyword detection and response within 200 milliseconds).
   - Minimizing power consumption to extend battery life on embedded devices.
   - Ensuring the model's size is optimized for the available memory on the device.

3. **Benchmarks for Success:**
   Establish clear metrics to measure the success of the KWS system. This could include:
   - True Positive Rate: The percentage of correctly identified keywords.
   - False Positive Rate: The percentage of non-keywords incorrectly identified as keywords.
   - Response Time: The time taken from keyword utterance to system response.
   - Power Consumption: Average power used during keyword detection.

4. **Stakeholder Engagement and Understanding:**
   Engage with stakeholders, which might include device manufacturers, hardware and software developers, and end-users. Understand their needs, capabilities, and constraints. For instance:
   - Device manufacturers might prioritize low power consumption.
   - Software developers might emphasize ease of integration.
   - End-users would prioritize accuracy and responsiveness.

5. **Understanding the Constraints and Limitations of Embedded Systems:**
   Embedded devices come with their own set of challenges:
   - Memory Limitations: KWS models need to be lightweight to fit within the memory constraints of embedded devices. Typically, KWS models might need to be as small as 16KB to fit in the always-on island of the SoC. Moreover, this is just the model size. Additional application code for pre-processing may also need to fit within the memory constraints.
   - Processing Power: The computational capabilities of embedded devices are limited (few hundred MHz of clock speed), so the KWS model must be optimized for efficiency.
   - Power Consumption: Since many embedded devices are battery-powered, the KWS system must be power-efficient.
   - Environmental Challenges: Devices might be deployed in various environments, from quiet bedrooms to noisy industrial settings. The KWS system must be robust enough to function effectively across these scenarios.

6. **Data Collection and Analysis:**
   For a KWS system, the quality and diversity of data are paramount. Considerations might include:
   - Variety of Accents: Collect data from speakers with various accents to ensure wide-ranging recognition.
   - Background Noises: Include data samples with different ambient noises to train the model for real-world scenarios.
   - Keyword Variations: People might either pronounce keywords differently or have slight variations in the wake word itself. Ensure the dataset captures these nuances.

7. **Iterative Feedback and Refinement:**
    Once a prototype KWS system is developed, it's crucial to test it in real-world scenarios, gather feedback, and iteratively refine the model. This ensures that the system remains aligned with the defined problem and objectives. This is important because the deployment scenarios change over time as things evolve.




## Data Sourcing
The quality and diversity of data gathered is important for developing accurate and robust AI systems. Sourcing high-quality training data requires careful consideration of the objectives, resources, and ethical implications. Data can be obtained from various sources depending on the needs of the project:

### Pre-existing datasets
Platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) provide a convenient starting point. Pre-existing datasets are a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and businesses alike. One of their primary advantages is cost-efficiency. Creating a dataset from scratch can be both time-consuming and expensive, so having access to ready-made data can save significant resources. Moreover, many of these datasets, like [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/), have become standard benchmarks in the machine learning community, allowing for consistent performance comparisons across different models and algorithms. This availability of data means that experiments can be started immediately without any delays associated with data collection and preprocessing. In a fast moving field like ML, this expediency is important.

The quality assurance that comes with popular pre-existing datasets is important to consider because several datasets have errors in them. For instance, [the ImageNet dataset was found to have over 6.4% errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749). Given their widespread use, any errors or biases in these datasets are often identified and rectified by the community. This assurance is especially beneficial for students and newcomers to the field, as they can focus on learning and experimentation without worrying about data integrity. Supporting documentation that often accompanies existing datasets is invaluable, though this generally applies only to widely used datasets. Good documentation provides insights into the data collection process, variable definitions, and sometimes even offers baseline model performances. This information not only aids understanding but also promotes reproducibility in research, a cornerstone of scientific integrity; currently there is a crisis around [improving reproducibility in machine learning systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12206). When other researchers have access to the same data, they can validate findings, test new hypotheses, or apply different methodologies, thus allowing us to build on each other's work more rapidly.

While platforms like Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository are invaluable resources, it's essential to understand the context in which the data was collected. Researchers should be wary of potential overfitting when using popular datasets, as multiple models might have been trained on them, leading to inflated performance metrics. Sometimes these [datasets do not reflect the real-world data](https://venturebeat.com/uncategorized/3-big-problems-with-datasets-in-ai-and-machine-learning/).

In addition, bias, validity, and reproducibility issues may exist in these datasets and in recent years there is a growing awareness of these issues.

### Web Scraping

Web scraping refers to automated techniques for extracting data from websites. It typically involves sending HTTP requests to web servers, retrieving HTML content, and parsing that content to extract relevant information. Popular tools and frameworks for web scraping include Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium. These tools offer different functionalities, from parsing HTML content to automating web browser interactions, especially for websites that load content dynamically using JavaScript.

Web scraping can be an effective way to gather large datasets for training machine learning models, particularly when human-labeled data is scarce. For computer vision research, web scraping enables the collection of massive volumes of images and videos. Researchers have used this technique to build influential datasets like [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) and [OpenImages](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html). For example, one could scrape e-commerce sites to amass product photos for object recognition, or social media platforms to collect user uploads for facial analysis. Even before ImageNet, Stanford's [LabelMe](https://people.csail.mit.edu/torralba/publications/labelmeApplications.pdf) project scraped Flickr for over 63,000 annotated images covering hundreds of object categories.

Beyond computer vision, web scraping supports the gathering of textual data for natural language tasks. Researchers can scrape news sites for sentiment analysis data, forums, and review sites for dialogue systems research, or social media for topic modeling. For example, the training data for chatbot ChatGPT was obtained by scraping much of the public internet. GitHub repositories were scraped to train GitHub's Copilot AI coding assistant.

Web scraping can also collect structured data like stock prices, weather data, or product information for analytical applications. Once data is scraped, it is essential to store it in a structured manner, often using databases or data warehouses. Proper data management ensures the usability of the scraped data for future analysis and applications.

However, while web scraping offers numerous advantages, there are significant limitations and ethical considerations to bear in mind. Not all websites permit scraping, and violating these restrictions can lead to legal repercussions. It is also unethical and potentially illegal to scrape copyrighted material or private communications. Ethical web scraping mandates adherence to a website's 'robots.txt' file, which outlines the sections of the site that can be accessed and scraped by automated bots. To deter automated scraping, many websites implement rate limits. If a bot sends too many requests in a short period, it might be temporarily blocked, restricting the speed of data access. Additionally, the dynamic nature of web content means that data scraped at different intervals might lack consistency, posing challenges for longitudinal studies. Though there are emerging trends like [Web Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09195) where machine learning algorithms can automatically navigate the website to access the dynamic content.

For niche subjects, the volume of pertinent data available for scraping might be limited. For example, while scraping for common topics like images of cats and dogs might yield abundant data, searching for rare medical conditions might not be as fruitful. Moreover, the data obtained through scraping is often unstructured and noisy, necessitating thorough preprocessing and cleaning. It is crucial to understand that not all scraped data will be of high quality or accuracy. Employing verification methods, such as cross-referencing with alternate data sources, can enhance data reliability.

Privacy concerns arise when scraping personal data, emphasizing the need for anonymization. Therefore, it is paramount to adhere to a website's Terms of Service, confine data collection to public domains, and ensure the anonymity of any personal data acquired.

While web scraping can be a scalable method to amass large training datasets for AI systems, its applicability is confined to specific data types. For example, sourcing data for Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) for gesture recognition is not straightforward through web scraping. At most, one might be able to scrape an existing dataset.


### Crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing for datasets is the practice of obtaining data by using the services of a large number of people, either from a specific community or the general public, typically via the internet. Instead of relying on a small team or specific organization to collect or label data, crowdsourcing leverages the collective effort of a vast, distributed group of participants. Services like Amazon Mechanical Turk enable the distribution of annotation tasks to a large, diverse workforce. This facilitates the collection of labels for complex tasks like sentiment analysis or image recognition that specifically require human judgment.

Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective approach for many data collection and problem-solving needs. One major advantage of crowdsourcing is scalability—by distributing tasks to a large, global pool of contributors on digital platforms, projects can process huge volumes of data in a short timeframe. This makes crowdsourcing ideal for large-scale data labeling, collection, and analysis.

In addition, crowdsourcing taps into a diverse group of participants, bringing a wide range of perspectives, cultural insights, and language abilities that can enrich data and enhance creative problem-solving in ways that a more homogenous group may not. Because crowdsourcing draws from a large audience beyond traditional channels, it also tends to be more cost-effective than conventional methods, especially for simpler microtasks.

Crowdsourcing platforms also allow for great flexibility, as task parameters can be adjusted in real-time based on initial results. This creates a feedback loop for iterative improvements to the data collection process. Complex jobs can be broken down into microtasks and distributed to multiple people, with cross-validation of results by assigning redundant versions of the same task. Ultimately, when thoughtfully managed, crowdsourcing enables community engagement around a collaborative project, where participants find reward in contributing.

However, while crowdsourcing offers numerous advantages, it’s essential to approach it with a clear strategy. While it provides access to a diverse set of annotators, it also introduces variability in the quality of annotations. Additionally, platforms like Mechanical Turk might not always capture a complete demographic spectrum; often tech-savvy individuals are overrepresented, while children and the elderly may be underrepresented. It’s crucial to provide clear instructions and possibly even training for the annotators. Periodic checks and validations of the labeled data can help maintain quality. This ties back to the topic of clear Problem Definition that we discussed earlier. Crowdsourcing for datasets also requires careful attention to ethical considerations. It’s crucial to ensure that participants are informed about how their data will be used and that their privacy is protected. Quality control through detailed protocols, transparency in sourcing, and auditing is essential to ensure reliable outcomes.

For TinyML, crowdsourcing can pose some unique challenges. TinyML devices are highly specialized for particular tasks within tight constraints. As a result, the data they require tends to be very specific. It may be difficult to obtain such specialized data from a general audience through crowdsourcing. For example, TinyML applications often rely on data collected from certain sensors or hardware. Crowdsourcing would require participants to have access to very specific and consistent devices - like microphones with the same sampling rates. Even for simple audio tasks like keyword spotting, these hardware nuances present obstacles.

Beyond hardware, the data itself needs high granularity and quality given the limitations of TinyML. It can be hard to ensure this when crowdsourcing from those unfamiliar with the application's context and requirements. There are also potential issues around privacy, real-time collection, standardization, and technical expertise. Moreover, the narrow nature of many TinyML tasks makes accurate data labeling difficult without the proper understanding. Participants may struggle to provide reliable annotations without full context.

Thus, while crowdsourcing can work well in many cases, the specialized needs of TinyML introduce unique data challenges. Careful planning is required for guidelines, targeting, and quality control. For some applications, crowdsourcing may be feasible, but others may require more focused data collection efforts to obtain relevant, high-quality training data.


### Synthetic Data
Synthetic data generation can be useful for addressing some of the limitations of data collection. It involves creating data that wasn’t originally captured or observed, but is generated using algorithms, simulations, or other techniques to resemble real-world data. It has become a valuable tool in various fields, particularly in scenarios where real-world data is scarce, expensive, or ethically challenging to obtain (e.g., TinyML). Various techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), can produce high-quality synthetic data that is almost indistinguishable from real data. These techniques have advanced significantly, making synthetic data generation increasingly realistic and reliable.

In many domains, especially emerging ones, there may not be enough real-world data available for analysis or training machine learning models. Synthetic data can fill this gap by producing large volumes of data that mimic real-world scenarios. For instance, detecting the sound of breaking glass might be challenging in security applications where a TinyML device is trying to identify break-ins. Collecting real-world data would require breaking numerous windows, which is impractical and costly.

Moreover, in machine learning, especially in deep learning, having a diverse dataset is crucial. Synthetic data can augment existing datasets by introducing variations, thereby enhancing the robustness of models. For example, SpecAugment is an excellent data augmentation technique for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems.

Pivacy and confidentiality is also a big issue. Datasets containing sensitive or personal information pose privacy concerns when shared or used. Synthetic data, being artificially generated, doesn’t have these direct ties to real individuals, allowing for safer use while preserving essential statistical properties.

Generating synthetic data, especially once the generation mechanisms have been established, can be a more cost-effective alternative. In the aforementioned security application scenario, synthetic data eliminates the need for breaking multiple windows to gather relevant data.

Many embedded use-cases deal with unique situations, such as manufacturing plants, that are difficult to simulate. Synthetic data allows researchers complete control over the data generation process, enabling the creation of specific scenarios or conditions that are challenging to capture in real life.

While synthetic data offers numerous advantages, it is essential to use it judiciously. Care must be taken to ensure that the generated data accurately represents the underlying real-world distributions and does not introduce unintended biases.


## Data Storage
TBD



## Data Processing
Data processing refers to the steps involved in transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for feeding into machine learning algorithms. It is a crucial stage in any machine learning workflow, yet often overlooked. Without proper data processing, machine learning models are unlikely to achieve optimal performance. “Data preparation accounts for about 60-80% of the work of a data scientist.”

![A breakdown of tasks that data scientists allocate their time to, highlighting the significant portion spent on data cleaning and organizing.](images/data_engineering_features.png)

Proper data cleaning is a crucial step that directly impacts model performance. Real-world data is often dirty - it contains errors, missing values, noise, anomalies, and inconsistencies. Data cleaning involves detecting and fixing these issues to prepare high-quality data for modeling. By carefully selecting appropriate techniques, data scientists can improve model accuracy, reduce overfitting, and enable algorithms to learn more robust patterns. Overall, thoughtful data processing allows machine learning systems to better uncover insights and make predictions from real-world data.

Data often comes from diverse sources and can be unstructured or semi-structured. Thus, it’s essential to process and standardize it, ensuring it adheres to a uniform format. Such transformations may include:

- Normalizing numerical variables
- Encoding categorical variables
- Using techniques like dimensionality reduction

Data validation serves a broader role than just ensuring adherence to certain standards like preventing temperature values from falling below absolute zero. These types of issues arise in TinyML because sensors may malfunction or temporarily produce incorrect readings, such transients are not uncommon. Therefore, it is imperative to catch data errors early before they propagate through the data pipeline. Rigorous validation processes, including verifying the initial annotation practices, detecting outliers, and handling missing values through techniques like mean imputation[^3], contribute directly to the quality of datasets. This, in turn, impacts the performance, fairness, and safety of the models trained on them.

![A detailed overview of the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus (MSWC) data processing pipeline: from raw audio and text data input, through forced alignment for word boundary estimation, to keyword extraction and model training](images/data_engineering_kws2.png)

Let’s take a look at an example of a data processing pipeline. In the context of tinyML, the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus (MSWC) is an example of data processing pipelines—systematic and automated workflows for data transformation, storage, and processing. By streamlining the data flow, from raw data to usable datasets, data pipelines enhance productivity and facilitate the rapid development of machine learning models. The MSWC is an expansive and expanding collection of audio recordings of spoken words in 50 different languages, which are collectively used by over 5 billion people. This dataset is intended for academic study and business uses in areas like keyword identification and speech-based search. It is openly licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 for broad usage.

The MSWC used a [forced alignment](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) method to automatically extract individual word recordings to train keyword-spotting models from the [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/) project, which features crowdsourced sentence-level recordings. Forced alignment refers to a group of long-standing methods in speech processing that are used to predict when speech phenomena like syllables, words, or sentences start and end within an audio recording. In the MSWC data, crowd-sourced recordings often feature background noises, such as static and wind. Depending on the model’s requirements, these noises can be removed or intentionally retained.

Maintaining the integrity of the data infrastructure is a continuous endeavor. This encompasses data storage, security, error handling, and stringent version control. Periodic updates are crucial, especially in dynamic realms like keyword spotting, to adjust to evolving linguistic trends and device integrations.

There is a boom of data processing pipelines, these are commonly found in ML operations toolchains, which we will discuss in the MLOps chapter. Briefly, these include frameworks like MLOps by Google Cloud.  It provides methods for automation and monitoring at all steps of ML system construction, including integration, testing, releasing, deployment, and infrastructure management, and there are several mechanisms that specifically focus on data processing which is an integral part of these systems.
