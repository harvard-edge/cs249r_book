## Data Sourcing
The quality and type of data gathered can significantly affect the performance of both the trained model and its downstream applications. This is particularly true in embedded systems where computational resources may be limited, necessitating models that are both accurate and efficient. Generally, data can be sourced from various places depending on the project's objectives. Some common data sources include pre-existing datasets, web scraping, sensors, APIs, and crowdsourcing.

Pre-existing datasets are often the starting point for many machine learning projects. These datasets, already collected by someone else, are publicly available. Websites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) offer such datasets for a variety of tasks, ranging from natural language processing to computer vision. These datasets are generally clean, well-documented, and ready for immediate use.

Crowdsourcing is another effective method, particularly for tasks requiring human judgment. Services like [Amazon's Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) facilitate the distribution of micro-tasks to a large number of people who can assist in labeling or annotating data. This method is frequently employed for natural language tasks such as sentiment analysis, or for image recognition tasks that may require human interpretation for contextual understanding. A notable example of crowdsourcing is the [ImageNet project](http://www.image-net.org/). ImageNet sourced candidate images from the internet and then used crowdsourcing to annotate these images, categorizing them into thousands of object classes. This approach took advantage of massive parallelism, making it possible to annotate a large dataset in a time-efficient manner—a task that would have been nearly impossible for a small group to accomplish. Another example is [Mozilla's Common Voice project](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en), which has successfully gathered a publicly available dataset of diverse voice recordings. Volunteers from around the world contribute by recording phrases in their native languages and accents. They also review and validate the recordings submitted by other users. Through this method, Common Voice has amassed a large, high-quality, and ethically sourced dataset that is freely accessible for research and development in the field of speech recognition.

Data can also be directly sourced from the field through sensors or devices, especially in the context of embedded systems or IoT devices. For instance, a weather station might collect real-time data on temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Such data is often raw and must be pre-processed before it can be utilized in a machine learning model.

APIs offer another channel for data collection. Various services like [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api), [Google](https://developers.google.com/products), or financial platforms provide APIs through which data can be collected programmatically. This allows for real-time data sourcing and can be customized to collect only the information that is relevant to the project.
