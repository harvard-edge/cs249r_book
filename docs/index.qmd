Welcome to the official developer documentation for the **MLSys** library. This package is the computational engine behind the *Machine Learning Systems* textbook.

### 🏗 The 5-Layer Stack

The library is designed hierarchically, ensuring that every simulation is grounded in physical truth:

1.  **Physics (`mlsys.formulas`)**: The "Iron Laws" of movement and compute.
2.  **Ledger (`mlsys.ledger`)**: The multi-dimensional scorecard for all results.
3.  **Engine (`mlsys.engine`)**: The analytical solver for single-node performance.
4.  **Personas (`mlsys.personas`)**: The scale multipliers (Cloud, Edge, Mobile, Tiny).
5.  **Simulations (`mlsys.simulations`)**: The decision logic that ties everything together.

### 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

If you want to build a custom lab or profile a new hardware architecture, you can import the library directly into any Python environment:

```python
import mlsys

# Choose a persona and a hardware scenario
persona = mlsys.Personas.TinyPioneer
scenario = mlsys.Applications.Doorbell

# Run a resource simulation
sim = mlsys.ResourceSimulation(scenario, persona)
ledger = sim.evaluate({"region": "Quebec"})

print(f"Annual Carbon: {ledger.sustainability.carbon_kg:.1f} kg")
```
