# Pre-commit Part Key Validation - Summary

## What We Implemented

You were absolutely right! Instead of doing validation in the GitHub workflow, we moved it to **pre-commit hooks** where it belongs. This catches issues before they even get committed, let alone pushed to the workflow.

## ✅ **What's Now in Place:**

### 1. Pre-commit Hook
- **Location**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- **Trigger**: Runs on every commit
- **Action**: Validates all part keys in `.qmd` files
- **Result**: Blocks commit if invalid keys found

### 2. Validation Script
- **Location**: `scripts/validate_part_keys.py`
- **Function**: Scans all 65+ `.qmd` files
- **Checks**: Validates against `book/part_summaries.yml`
- **Output**: Detailed error report with file/line numbers

### 3. Easy-to-Use Tools
- **Quick check**: `pre-commit run validate-part-keys --all-files`
- **Wrapper script**: `./scripts/check_keys.sh`
- **Direct validation**: `python3 scripts/validate_part_keys.py`

## 🚀 **Benefits of Pre-commit Approach:**

1. **Catches issues early** - before commit, not after push
2. **Faster feedback** - no waiting for CI/CD
3. **Prevents broken commits** - keeps history clean
4. **Developer-friendly** - immediate feedback
5. **Reduces CI/CD load** - fewer failed builds

## 📊 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **15 valid keys** in `part_summaries.yml`
- ✅ **65+ .qmd files** scanned
- ✅ **0 issues** found
- ✅ **Pre-commit hook** working perfectly

## 🔧 **How to Use:**

### For Developers:
```bash
# Normal workflow (validation runs automatically)
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
# If invalid keys found, commit is blocked
```

### For Manual Testing:
```bash
# Test validation
pre-commit run validate-part-keys --all-files

# Or run directly
python3 scripts/validate_part_keys.py
```

## 🛠️ **Removed from Workflow:**

- ❌ Removed validation step from `.github/workflows/quarto-build.yml`
- ✅ Validation now happens in pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Faster, more efficient, developer-friendly

## 🎯 **Result:**

The `key:xxx` error you were seeing will now be **caught before commit**, preventing it from ever reaching the build process. This is much more efficient and user-friendly than catching it in the workflow.

*This approach is much better because it catches issues at the source (during development) rather than after they've been pushed to the repository.*
