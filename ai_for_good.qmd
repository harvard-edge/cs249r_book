# AI for Good

By aligning AI progress with human values, goals, and ethics, the ultimate goal of ML systems (at any scale) is to be a technology that reflects human principles and aspirations. Initiatives under "AI for Good" promote the development of AI to tackle the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using embedded AI technologies, expanding access to AI education, amongst other things. While it is now clear that AI will be an instrumental part of progress towards the SDGs, its adoption and impact are limited by the immense power consumption, strong connectivity requirements and high costs of cloud-based deployments. TinyML, applowing ML models to run on low-cost and low-power microcontrollers, can circumvent many of these issues.

> The "AI for Good" movement plays a critical role in cultivating a future where an AI-empowered society is more just, sustainable, and prosperous for all of humanity.

## Introduction

To give ourselves a framework around which to think about AI for social good, we will be following the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The UN SDGs are a collection of 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The SDGs address global challenges related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice. What is special about SDGs is that they are a collection of interlinked objectives designed to serve as a "shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.". The SDGs emphasize the interconnected environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainable development by putting sustainability at their center.

A recent study [@vinuesa2020role] highlights the influence of AI on all aspects of sustainable development, in particular on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets internationally defined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The study shows that AI can act as an enabler for 134 targets through technological improvements, but it also highlights the challenges of AI on some of the targets. When considering AI and societal outcomes, the study shows that AI can benefit 67 targets, but it also warns about the issues related to the implementation of AI in countries with different cultural values and wealth.

In the context of our book, here is how TinyML could potentially help advance at least _some_ of these SDG goals.  

- **Goal 1 - No Poverty**: TinyML could help provide low-cost solutions for tasks like crop monitoring to improve agricultural yields in developing countries.

- **Goal 2 - Zero Hunger**: TinyML could enable localized and precise crop health monitoring and disease detection to reduce crop losses.

- **Goal 3 - Good Health and Wellbeing**: TinyML could help enable low-cost medical diagnosis tools for early detection and prevention of diseases in remote areas. 

- **Goal 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation**: TinyML could monitor water quality and detect contaminants to ensure access to clean drinking water.

- **Goal 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy**: TinyML could optimize energy consumption and enable predictive maintenance for renewable energy infrastructure.

- **Goal 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities**: TinyML could enable intelligent traffic management, air quality monitoring, and optimized resource management in smart cities.

- **Goal 13 - Climate Action**: TinyML could monitor deforestation and track reforestation efforts. It could also help predict extreme weather events.

The portability, lower power requirements, and real-time analytics enabled by TinyML make it well-suited for addressing several sustainability challenges faced by developing regions. Widespread deployment of power solutions has the potential to provide localized and cost-effective monitoring to help achieve some of the UN SDGs. In the rest of the sections, we will dive into the details of how TinyML is useful across many of the sectors that have the potential to address the UN SDGs.

## Healthcare

Explanation: Healthcare is a critical sector where timely interventions can save lives. TinyML can enable real-time monitoring and predictions, making healthcare more proactive and personalized. 

- Remote health monitoring: Using TinyML for wearable health devices.
- Disease prediction and prevention: Early detection systems.
- Assistive technologies: Devices for the differently-abled.

An example of TinyML projects in healthcare is a low-cost solution to monitor atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm developed by UNIFEI in Brazil.  Traditional methods for monitoring heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm often rely on expensive medical-grade equipment and visits to healthcare facilities. However, this can be prohibitive for populations with limited access and resources. The solution developed by UNIFEI leverages TinyML and small microcontrollers to create a low-cost, accessible monitoring device. Specifically, the device uses an off-the-shelf microcontroller costing only a few dollars along with a pulse sensor that can be produced very cheaply. By minimizing the complexity and cost of components, the device becomes affordable for widespread distribution. The low production costs also enable scaling to large numbers of users. Furthermore, the device is designed to be simple to use, not requiring extensive training or expertise. This increases accessibility for patients in developing regions or remote areas without advanced healthcare infrastructure. Overall, the ultra-low-cost design democratizes access to vital health monitoring tools that can save lives. TinyML enables powerful AI capabilities to be deployed in affordable, accessible ways for underserved communities globally.

A collaborative paper led by researchers from the University of Khartoum in Sudan and the ICTP  in Italy presents the use of a low-cost device based on TinyML to detect mosquito species, which could lead to a more efficient malaria eradication campaign (@altayeb2022classifying). Mosquito-borne diseases are a major global health problem, infecting over one billion people and killing over one million people each year. Mosquitoes are the most common disease vectors and are found worldwide. Monitoring mosquito populations is essential for preventing and controlling mosquito-borne diseases, especially in resource-limited settings. Researchers have proposed using TinyML to identify mosquito species by their wingbeat patterns. This approach is low-power, low-cost, and can run without human intervention. This makes TinyML ideal for developing mosquito monitoring systems that can be deployed in remote areas. By adding communications capabilities, the system can send classification inference results over long distances. The use of TinyML in insect monitoring has the potential to revolutionize the field. By making mosquito monitoring more accessible and affordable, TinyML can help to reduce the burden of mosquito-borne diseases worldwide.


## Agriculture

Explanation: With the global population rising, sustainable and efficient farming is crucial. TinyML can optimize farming practices, ensuring food security and sustainability.

- Precision agriculture: Monitoring soil, weather, and crop conditions.
- Pest and disease detection: Early warning systems.
- Sustainable farming practices: Optimizing water and fertilizer use.

Agriculture is the common thread which holds the 17 SDGs together. Investing in the agricultural sector can address not only hunger and malnutrition but also other challenges including poverty; water and energy use; climate change; and unsustainable production and consumption. SDG 2  aims to eradicate all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030 but also to promote sustainable and resilient agricultural practices, including crop diversity, efficient resource use, and support for small-scale farmers. Sustainable agriculture is essential to meet growing food demands without depleting natural resources. Given its capability to provide data with no internet connection, TinyML can be used to support small-sclae farmers that are still unconnected. The low-cost of devices, on the other hand, allow for TinyML solutions to be scaled across large agricultural fields.  A concrete example of TinyML being used in agriculture is a low cost solution developed by researchers at UNIFEI in Brazil to detect diseases in coffee plants (@yamashita2023coffee). They used convolutional networks in a low-cost microcontrolled board to classify coffee leaf diseases in loco, without the need for an internet connection. Early identification of diseases in coffee plantations is crucial for productivity and production quality. The proposed architecture assisted in the diagnosis of diseases in coffee farms, especially those managed by producers with less resource

## Science

Explanation: Scientific research often requires data collection in challenging environments or over extended periods. TinyML can empower researchers with real-time data analysis, enabling more efficient and in-depth exploration in various scientific domains.

- Space Exploration: Using TinyML for onboard data processing in satellites and rovers, enabling quicker decision-making in environments with communication lags.
- Oceanography: Deploying embedded systems for monitoring marine life, water quality, and underwater geological activities.
- Ecology: Utilizing TinyML for tracking animal migration, studying habitats, and understanding ecological changes.
- Physics and Chemistry: Enhancing experimental setups with real-time data analysis, aiding in quicker hypothesis testing and validation.

In many areas of applied science researchers measure easily detectable parameters and then use simple semi-empirical correlations to infer the parameter they are really interested in. These correlations are often based on very limited data, and creating sensors to measure more directly variables of interest is critical. The advent of devices in which processing is accomplished automatically can increase the resolution of scientific data by orders of magnitude. An example of how TinyML can be used to increase scientific knowledge is the Ribbit Network. This project was developed to provide accurate readings of carbon dioxide gas through a crowdsourced network of open-source, low- cost, smart sensors [@Rao_2021]. This kind of high-quality data will help scientists better understand and predict the impacts of climate change.

## Conservation and Environment

Explanation: The planet's ecosystems are under threat, and timely data can aid conservation efforts. TinyML can provide real-time insights into environmental conditions and wildlife behavior.

- Wildlife monitoring: Using embedded devices for tracking and behavior analysis.
- Pollution detection: Monitoring air and water quality in real-time.
- Climate change: Data collection and analysis for climate models.


A survey on how TinyML can be used to solve environmental issues has been published by researchers from Moulay Ismail University of Meknes in Morocco (@bamoumen2022tinyml). A solution to use TinyML for wildlife conservation has been developed by using camera traps and applying TinyML to enable inference at the edge to help track wildlife movement and aid in wildlife conservation [@Sheth_2022]. A related solution called Smart Wildlife Tracker has also been developed [@Verma_2022]. The trackers are attached to elephant collars. The collars capture real-time elephant movements using a GPS and capture surrounding images so that TinyML can be used to predict events around each animal such as presence of human predators. Audio models are also applied to determine the mood of the elephant and an accelerometer is used to understand the physical behavior and movement of the elephant. The low power consumption of the devices allow for prolonged unattended use and can provide rich datasets to research scientists.

## Disaster Response

Explanation: Natural disasters can have devastating effects, but early warnings and efficient post-disaster management can mitigate their impact. TinyML can enhance these systems, making them more responsive.

- Early warning systems: Predicting and detecting natural disasters.
- Post-disaster management: Using TinyML for damage assessment and resource allocation.

## Education and Outreach

Explanation: TinyML can help personalize learning experiences and provide assistive tools, democratizing education.

- STEM education access via tinyML 
- Assistive tools: Devices to help with learning disabilities.

Two papers on outreach activities especially in Developing Countries have been presented at UN events in 2022 (@zennaro2022tinyml) and 2023 (@zennarobridging). The authors presented the TinyML4D network that was created in 2020 by Harvard University (US), Columbia University (US), International Centre for Theoretical Physics (Italy), and UNIFEI (Brazil) to support universities working on TinyML in developing countries. The network focuses on academic institutions, based in Developing Countries, interested in expanding access to Applied Machine Learning by establishing best practices in education. They aim to ultimately develop a community of researchers and practitioners focused on both improving access to TinyML education and enabling innovative solutions for the unique challenges faced by Developing Countries. Member institutions are involved in research activities in IoT or AI. The network has created lab facilities for hands-on sessions and training courses. Today the TinyML4D network has more than 50 members.

## Accessibility

Explanation: For a more inclusive world, tools and devices need to cater to people of all abilities. TinyML can power devices that bridge the gap, ensuring everyone has access to essential services and experiences.

- Devices for the differently-abled: Hearing aids, mobility devices, etc.
- Translation and communication tools: Breaking down language barriers.

## Infrastructure and Urban Planning

Explanation: As urban areas grow, managing infrastructure efficiently becomes paramount. TinyML can optimize various urban systems, making cities more livable and sustainable.

- Traffic management: Optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion.
- Energy management: Smart grids and energy consumption optimization.

## Challenges and Considerations

Explanation: While AI for Good has immense potential, it's essential to address the challenges and ethical considerations to ensure the technology benefits all without causing harm.

- Data privacy and security in AI for Good applications.
- Ensuring equitable access to AI-powered solutions.
- Avoiding unintended negative consequences.

A paper on the use of TinyML in Africa and its potential has been published by researchers from Rwanda (@ooko2021tinyml). Authors highlighted the main benefits of TinyML in the framework of ICT4D (the use of ICT in a developing context):

* Connectivity: TinyML nodes operate independently, without the need for existing network infrastructure, as they perform computations locally on the node. This offers a significant benefit, especially considering that, as per recent statistics, approximately half of the world's population remains unconnected to the Internet. Furthermore, in many developing nations, stringent regulations regarding spectrum usage present a challenge when it comes to establishing wireless connections

* Low-cost: TinyML relies on microcontrollers and the cost of a microcontroller is well below 1USD today and is predicted to be 0.55USD in 2023, making this technology affordable and thus scalable. 

* Appropriate user interfaces: sensor network data is typically stored as numerical information on a server, accessible through web interfaces presenting data in the form of graphs, charts, and spreadsheets. While this format serves literate users in developed nations well, it offers limited utility to illiterate individuals in developing countries. It is crucial to provide on-device result summaries to make the application truly beneficial. The "keyword spotting" application on TinyML devices enables the creation of voice-based applications in local languages, further reducing barriers for local communities.

  • Power: power issues are prevalent in remote and rural areas worldwide. In Africa, access to the power grid is both unreliable and scarce, with approximately only 20% of the African population having access to electricity. For many, power rationing and frequent outages are a regular occurrence in their daily lives. TinyML devices have minimal energy requirements, typically operating in the range of milliwatts. These devices often come with their own power sources, such as AA batteries, and can also be equipped with efficient energy harvesting techniques like solar cells.


The authors conclude that challenges hindering the implementation of TinyML include lack of datasets, inadequate training and expertise, difficulty in accessing hardware platforms and inadequate financial resources. Nonetheless, the challenges are addressable and present an opportunity in having localized data collection initiatives, developing courses and training centers, scaling regional distribution centers in Africa to provision TinyML specific hardware challenges and dedicated investments towards TinyML.
