# AI for Good

All of this technological discussion around embedded AI and TinyML we have been talking about so far has the potential to transform humanity's greatest challenges. Initiatives under "AI for Good" promote the development of AI to further the UN Sustainable Development Goals using embedded AI technologies, expanding access to AI education, amongst other things. By aligning AI progress with human values, goals, and ethics, the ultimate goal of ML systems (at any scale) is to be a technology that reflects human principles and aspirations.

> The "AI for Good" movement plays a critical role in cultivating a future where an AI-empowered society is more just, sustainable, and prosperous for all of humanity.

## Introduction

To give ourselves a framework around which to think about AI for social good, we will be following the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The UN SDGs are a collection of 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The SDGs address global challenges related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice.

In the context of our book, here is how TinyML could potentially help advance at least _some_ of these SDG goals:

- **Goal 1 - No Poverty**: TinyML could help provide low-cost solutions for tasks like crop monitoring to improve agricultural yields in developing countries.

- **Goal 2 - Zero Hunger**: TinyML could enable localized and precise crop health monitoring and disease detection to reduce crop losses.

- **Goal 3 - Good Health and Wellbeing**: TinyML could help enable low-cost medical diagnosis tools for early detection and prevention of diseases in remote areas. 

- **Goal 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation**: TinyML could monitor water quality and detect contaminants to ensure access to clean drinking water.

- **Goal 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy**: TinyML could optimize energy consumption and enable predictive maintenance for renewable energy infrastructure.

- **Goal 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities**: TinyML could enable intelligent traffic management, air quality monitoring, and optimized resource management in smart cities.

- **Goal 13 - Climate Action**: TinyML could monitor deforestation and track reforestation efforts. It could also help predict extreme weather events.

The portability, lower power requirements, and real-time analytics enabled by TinyML make it well-suited for addressing several sustainability challenges faced by developing regions. Widespread deployment of power solutions has the potential to provide localized and cost-effective monitoring to help achieve some of the UN SDGs. In the rest of the sections, we will dive into the details of how TinyML is useful across many of the sectors that have the potential to address the UN SDGs.
