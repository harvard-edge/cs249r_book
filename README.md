## 🧠 About the Project

MLSysBook began as a Harvard course and has since grown into a **global educational movement** focused on teaching ML through a **systems-first lens**.

We go beyond training models — our goal is to help learners understand and build the full stack of real-world ML systems, from edge devices to cloud-scale deployment.
