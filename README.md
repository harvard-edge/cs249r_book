## About This Book

The **open-source textbook** that teaches you to build real-world AI systems — from edge devices to cloud deployment. Originally developed as Harvard University's CS249r course by [Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://github.com/profvjreddi/homepage), now used by universities and students worldwide.

> **Our mission:** Expand access to AI systems education worldwide — empowering learners, one chapter and one lab at a time.

### Why This Book Exists

*"This grew out of a concern that while students could train AI models, few understood how to build the systems that actually make them work. As AI becomes more capable and autonomous, the critical bottleneck won't be the algorithms - it will be the engineers who can build efficient, scalable, and sustainable systems that safely harness that intelligence."*

**— Vijay Janapa Reddi**

## 📚 What You'll Learn

Go beyond training models — master the **full stack** of real-world ML systems.

| Topic | What You'll Build |
|-------|------------------|
| **System Design** | Scalable, maintainable ML architectures |
| **Data Engineering** | Robust pipelines for collection, labeling, and processing |
| **Model Deployment** | Production-ready systems from prototypes |
| **MLOps & Monitoring** | Reliable, continuously operating systems |
| **Edge AI** | Resource-efficient deployment on mobile, embedded, and IoT |

## 🛠️ Development

### Book Binder CLI (Recommended)

The **Book Binder** is our lightning-fast development CLI for streamlined building and iteration:

```bash
# Fast chapter development
./binder build intro html             # Build single chapter  
./binder build intro,ml_systems html  # Build multiple chapters together
./binder preview intro                # Build and preview chapter

# Full book building
./binder build * html                 # Build complete website
./binder build * pdf                  # Build complete PDF

# Management
./binder clean                    # Clean artifacts
./binder status                   # Show current status
./binder help                     # Show all commands
```

### Make Commands (Traditional)
```bash
# Building
make build          # Build HTML version
make build-pdf      # Build PDF version
make preview        # Start development server

# Quality Control  
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
make test           # Run validation tests
make lint           # Check for issues

# Get help
make help           # Show all commands
```
