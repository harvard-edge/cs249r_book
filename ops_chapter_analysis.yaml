        current_text: "Having established how to build efficient models and measure their performance systematically in Part III, we now confront a critical reality: even perfectly optimized models fail in production without operational discipline."
        replacement_text: "Part III demonstrated how to optimize individual models for speed, accuracy, and resource efficiency through techniques like quantization, pruning, and hardware acceleration. However, achieving optimal model performance represents only the foundation for production success. Part IV shifts focus from model-level optimization to system-level operational challenges: a quantized model that achieves 10x speedup provides no value if data drift silently degrades accuracy, deployment pipelines cannot reliably deliver updates, or monitoring systems fail to detect performance degradation before users are impacted."

These frameworks build upon the hardware acceleration principles covered in @sec-ai-acceleration to achieve optimal inference performance. These frameworks handle versioning, scaling, and monitoring."
        replacement_text: "Production deployment requires frameworks that handle model packaging, versioning, and integration with serving infrastructure.

        replacement_text: "The operational foundations established here enable the advanced deployment scenarios explored in subsequent Part IV chapters. On-device learning (@sec-ondevice-learning) extends these MLOps principles to resource-constrained environments where traditional cloud-based monitoring and updates face fundamental limitations. Robust AI systems (@sec-robust-ai) build upon the monitoring and validation frameworks introduced here to handle adversarial inputs and distribution shifts that threaten deployed models. Privacy and security considerations (@sec-privacy-security) layer additional operational requirements onto the deployment and monitoring infrastructure, requiring specialized techniques for training and serving models while protecting sensitive data."

However, machine learning systems introduce unique forms of complexity that can accumulate over time, creating hidden maintenance burdens. Unlike traditional software where broken code fails immediately, ML systems can degrade silently through data changes, model interactions, and evolving requirements. Understanding these hidden costs—collectively known as technical debt—is essential for designing sustainable ML systems."

    optional_improvements:
      - action: "Add DevOps primer for readers without operations background"
        location_method: "Search for 'Understanding this evolution from DevOps to MLOps' in Historical Context section"
        insertion_point: "Before the DevOps subsection, after the Historical Context introduction"
        text_to_add: "Before examining MLOps evolution, it's helpful to understand the operational challenges that DevOps originally addressed. Traditional software development suffered from the 'wall of confusion' between development teams (who built software) and operations teams (who deployed and maintained it). Development teams optimized for feature velocity and functionality, while operations teams prioritized stability and reliability. This created conflicts: developers wanted frequent releases with new features, while operations teams preferred infrequent, thoroughly tested deployments. The resulting friction led to delayed releases, production failures, and finger-pointing between teams when systems failed."
