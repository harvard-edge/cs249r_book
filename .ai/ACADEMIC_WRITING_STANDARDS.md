# 📚 MLSysBook Academic Writing Standards

**CRITICAL**: These standards apply to ALL content creation, modification, and AI interactions with the textbook. Every AI assistant must read and apply these standards consistently.

## 🎯 Core Principle

This is a **formal academic textbook** for machine learning systems. ALL content must maintain the highest academic standards while remaining accessible to students.

## 📝 Tone Requirements

EVERY content addition or modification must:

### 1. **Match Surrounding Tone** ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **ALWAYS read 2-3 paragraphs before and after** any modification
- **Analyze the specific tone, style, and formality level** of the surrounding text
- **Mirror the exact writing patterns** used in that section
- **Ensure seamless integration** - new text should be indistinguishable from original content
- **Maintain consistent voice** throughout the entire section

### 2. **Use Formal Academic Language**
**Avoid informal expressions:**
- ❌ "Let's look at" → ✅ "Consider"
- ❌ "You can see" → ✅ "One observes" 
- ❌ "Pretty much" → ✅ "Essentially"
- ❌ "A lot of" → ✅ "Substantial" or "Significant"
- ❌ "Really important" → ✅ "Critical" or "Essential"
- ❌ "Tons of" → ✅ "Numerous" or "Extensive"
- ❌ "Super fast" → ✅ "Highly efficient"
- ❌ "It's obvious that" → ✅ "It follows that"

### 3. **Maintain Objective Voice**
- Use passive voice where appropriate
- Avoid conversational phrases and colloquialisms
- Present facts without hyperbole or emotional language
- Support claims with citations when possible
- Avoid first person ("I", "we") unless in specific contexts

### 4. **Preserve Pedagogical Structure**
- Define terms before using them
- Build concepts progressively from simple to complex
- Use consistent terminology throughout all chapters
- Maintain logical flow from prerequisites to advanced topics
- Ensure each section builds on previous knowledge

### 5. **Blend Seamlessly**
- New text should be indistinguishable from existing content
- Maintain paragraph rhythm and sentence structure patterns
- Use similar transitional phrases as surrounding text
- Match the complexity level of surrounding content

## 🔍 Pre-Writing Process

### Before Writing Any Content:
1. **Read the entire section** for full context
2. **Note the specific academic style** used in that chapter
3. **Identify key terminology patterns** and definitions
4. **Match the level of formality** exactly
5. **Check chapter position** for appropriate difficulty level

## 🎯 Contextual Editing Rules

### When Making ANY Edit (Critical Process):

1. **Context Reading** (MANDATORY):
   - Read **minimum 2-3 paragraphs before** the edit location
   - Read **minimum 2-3 paragraphs after** the edit location
   - Understand the **flow of ideas** and **argument structure**

2. **Tone Analysis** (MANDATORY):
   - **Identify sentence patterns** (length, complexity, structure)
   - **Note transitional phrases** and connecting words used
   - **Observe formality level** (highly formal vs. moderately formal)
   - **Detect author's voice** (passive vs. active, objective vs. explanatory)

3. **Style Matching** (MANDATORY):
   - **Copy the exact writing style** of surrounding paragraphs
   - **Use similar sentence structures** and paragraph organization
   - **Match vocabulary sophistication** level
   - **Maintain consistent tense and voice** patterns

4. **Integration Verification** (MANDATORY):
   - **Read the entire section aloud** after editing
   - **Ensure no jarring transitions** or tone shifts
   - **Verify logical flow** remains intact
   - **Check that new content feels native** to the existing text

### Pattern Matching Examples:
**If surrounding text says:**
> "The architecture exhibits substantial computational efficiency through optimized memory hierarchies..."

**Write similarly:**
> "The interconnects demonstrate significant bandwidth advantages via advanced routing protocols..."

**NOT:**
> "These interconnects are really fast and work great because they're efficient..."

## 📖 Content Quality Standards

### Technical Accuracy
- **Verify all technical claims** against authoritative sources
- **Maintain consistency** with established definitions across chapters
- **Use precise terminology** from the field of machine learning systems
- **Cite sources** for claims, especially cutting-edge research
- **Cross-reference** related concepts appropriately

### Pedagogical Excellence
- **Progressive complexity**: Each chapter builds on previous knowledge
- **Clear definitions**: Introduce terms before using them extensively  
- **Practical relevance**: Connect theory to real-world applications
- **Consistent difficulty**: Match the chapter's position in the learning sequence
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Address topic thoroughly within scope

### Writing Mechanics
- **Grammar and syntax**: Flawless academic English
- **Paragraph structure**: Clear topic sentences, supporting details, transitions
- **Sentence variety**: Mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences
- **Active vs passive voice**: Use appropriately for academic tone
- **Transitions**: Smooth connections between ideas and sections

## 🎓 Chapter-Specific Considerations

### Early Chapters (1-5): Foundational
- **Simpler language** while maintaining formality
- **More definitions** and explanations of basic concepts
- **Gentle introduction** to technical terminology
- **Broader context** before diving into specifics

### Middle Chapters (6-15): Intermediate
- **Assume foundational knowledge** from earlier chapters
- **Introduce advanced concepts** with appropriate scaffolding
- **Balance theory and practice** with real-world examples
- **Cross-reference** earlier concepts frequently

### Advanced Chapters (16-20): Specialized
- **Higher technical density** appropriate for advanced students
- **Assume mastery** of foundational and intermediate concepts
- **Focus on cutting-edge** research and applications
- **Integrate knowledge** across multiple domains

## 🔧 Content Modification Guidelines

### For Technical Corrections
1. **Identify the error** and its scope of impact
2. **Research authoritative sources** for correct information
3. **Check consistency** across all related mentions
4. **Update cross-references** if terminology changes
5. **Add clarifying examples** if concept is complex

### For Clarity Improvements
1. **Identify confusion sources** (ambiguous terms, unclear flow)
2. **Restructure explanations** using progressive disclosure
3. **Add concrete examples** to illustrate abstract concepts
4. **Improve transitions** between related ideas
5. **Maintain technical accuracy** while improving accessibility

### For Structural Changes
1. **Preserve learning progression** across sections
2. **Update cross-references** and internal links
3. **Maintain consistent formatting** with existing content
4. **Ensure new sections** fit the chapter's overall narrative
5. **Validate navigation** and table of contents

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Language Issues
- **Tone inconsistency**: NEVER write in a different style than surrounding text
- **Context ignorance**: NEVER edit without reading surrounding paragraphs
- **Style jarring**: NEVER use different formality levels within the same section
- **Informal contractions**: Don't use "don't", "can't", "won't"
- **Colloquial expressions**: Avoid slang or casual phrases
- **Anthropomorphism**: Don't give human qualities to systems ("the network thinks")
- **Absolute statements**: Avoid "always", "never" without qualification
- **Vague quantifiers**: Replace "many", "some", "few" with specific numbers when possible

### Technical Issues
- **Inconsistent terminology**: Use the same term for the same concept throughout
- **Undefined acronyms**: Always define before first use in each chapter
- **Missing context**: Don't assume knowledge not covered in previous chapters
- **Outdated information**: Verify currency of technical details and research
- **Unsupported claims**: Provide citations for non-obvious statements

### Pedagogical Issues
- **Knowledge gaps**: Don't skip necessary intermediate steps
- **Circular definitions**: Don't define terms using the terms themselves
- **Inconsistent difficulty**: Match the chapter's intended complexity level
- **Poor examples**: Ensure examples clearly illustrate the concept
- **Missing connections**: Link new concepts to previously learned material
