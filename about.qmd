## **Course Requirements**

* **Basic Programming Knowledge**: It is *recommended* that readers have some prior experience with programming, preferably in Python. Understanding variables, data types, control structures, and basic programming concepts will facilitate comprehension and engagement with the book.

* **Familiarity with Machine Learning Concepts**: While not *essential*, a basic understanding of machine learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, will help readers grasp the material more easily. However, the book provides sufficient explanations to bring readers up to speed if they are new to the field.

* **Python Programming Skills (Optional)**: Readers with some Python programming experience will have an advantage when engaging with the coding portions of the book. Familiarity with libraries such as *NumPy*, *scikit-learn*, and *TensorFlow* will greatly facilitate the implementation and experimentation with machine learning models.

* **Learning Mindset**: The book has been structured to be accessible to a wide audience, including readers with varying levels of technical expertise. It provides a gradual learning curve, allowing readers to start with general knowledge about the field, progress to coding exercises, and potentially advance to deploying models on embedded devices. However, to fully benefit from the book, readers should be willing to *challenge themselves* and engage in practical exercises and projects.

* **Availability of Resources**: To fully explore the practical aspects of TinyML, readers should have access to the necessary resources. These include a computer with Python and relevant libraries installed, as well as *optional access to an embedded development board or microcontroller* for experimenting with deploying machine learning models.

By ensuring that these general requirements are met, readers will have the opportunity to broaden their understanding of TinyML, gain hands-on experience with coding exercises, and even venture into practical implementation on embedded devices, enabling them to *push the boundaries* of their knowledge and skills.
