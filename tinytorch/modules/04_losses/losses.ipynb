    "Calculate:\n",
    "- How much memory does CrossEntropyLoss need for one forward pass? (Hint: B=128, C=50,000, float32)\n",
    "- If this exceeds your budget, what are three strategies to reduce memory usage?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>💡 Hint</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory for logits = Batch_Size × Num_Classes × 4 bytes (float32) = 128 × 50,000 × 4 = 25.6 MB\n",
    "\n",
    "For full forward pass with intermediate tensors (softmax, log_softmax), multiply by ~3 = 76.8 MB\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategies to reduce memory:\n",
    "1. **Sampled softmax**: Only compute softmax over subset of vocabulary (1000 samples)\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical softmax**: Use tree structure, O(log V) instead of O(V)\n",
    "3. **Mixed precision**: Use FP16 for forward pass (2 bytes instead of 4)\n",
    "4. **Gradient checkpointing**: Recompute intermediate activations instead of storing\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**Question 2: Loss Function Performance Bottleneck**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Bottleneck**: Loss computation (120ms) taking longer than forward pass (80ms) is unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Cause**: Softmax computation in CrossEntropyLoss is O(B×C). With C=1000, this dominates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "1. **Hierarchical softmax**: Reduces complexity from O(C) to O(log C)\n",
    "2. **Sampled softmax**: Only compute over subset of classes during training\n",
    "3. **Optimize softmax kernel**: Use fused operations (PyTorch does this automatically)\n",
    "4. **Check batch size**: Very small batches don't utilize GPU well\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reality Check**: In well-optimized PyTorch, loss should be ~5-10% of training time, not 35%!\n",
