    "# Module 20: Capstone - Benchmarking & Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the TinyTorch capstone! You've built an entire ML framework from scratch across 19 modules. Now it's time to demonstrate your work by benchmarking a model and generating a submission that showcases your framework's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Prerequisites & Progress\n",
    "**You've Built**: Complete ML framework with profiling (M14), quantization (M15), compression (M16), acceleration (M17), memoization (M18), and benchmarking (M19)\n",
    "**You'll Build**: Professional benchmark submission workflow with standardized reporting\n",
    "**You'll Enable**: Shareable, reproducible results demonstrating framework performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection Map**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Modules 01-13 → Optimization Suite (14-18) → Benchmarking (19) → Submission (20)\n",
    "(Framework)     (Performance Tools)            (Measurement)       (Results)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this capstone, you will:\n",
    "1. **Use** Module 19's benchmarking tools to measure model performance comprehensively\n",
    "2. **Apply** optimization techniques from Modules 14-18 to improve baseline models\n",
    "3. **Generate** standardized JSON submissions following industry best practices\n",
    "4. **Validate** submissions against a schema for reproducibility\n",
    "5. **Compare** baseline vs. optimized models with quantitative metrics\n",
    "6. **Share** your results with the TinyTorch community in a professional format\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: This module teaches you the complete workflow from model to measurable results - the foundation of ML systems engineering. In production, reproducible benchmarking is what separates research experiments from deployable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Where This Code Lives in the Final Package\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Side:** You work in `src/20_capstone/20_capstone.py`\n",
    "**Building Side:** Code exports to `tinytorch.olympics`\n",

    "# Generate submission\n",
    "submission = generate_submission(report)\n",
    "submission.save(\"my_submission.json\")\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- **Learning:** Complete workflow from model to shareable results\n",
    "- **Production:** Professional submission format mirroring MLPerf and Papers with Code standards\n",
    "- **Community:** Share and compare results with other builders using standardized metrics\n",

    "\n",
    "Over the past 19 modules, you built a complete ML framework from the ground up. You implemented tensors, layers, optimizers, loss functions, and advanced optimization techniques. But building a framework is only half the story.\n",

    "**The Missing Piece: Proving It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "In production ML systems, claims without measurements are worthless. When researchers publish papers or engineers deploy models, they need to answer fundamental questions:\n",
    "- How fast is inference on this hardware?\n",

    "- What's the accuracy-latency trade-off?\n",
    "- How do optimizations affect these metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Reproducibility Crisis in ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern ML faces a reproducibility crisis. Many published results can't be replicated because:\n",
    "- **Missing system details** - What hardware? What software versions?\n",
    "- **Inconsistent metrics** - Different ways to measure \"accuracy\" or \"latency\"\n",
    "- **Cherry-picked results** - Showing best runs without variance\n",
    "- **Incomplete reporting** - Omitting negative results or failed optimizations\n",

    "**Measurement Best Practices You Implemented:**\n",

    "2. **Statistical aggregation** - Report mean ± std, not single values\n",
    "3. **Multiple metrics** - Never optimize for just one dimension\n",

    "  → Could be outlier (GC pause? OS interrupt?)\n",
    "  → No confidence interval\n",
    "  → Can't detect performance regressions\n",
    "\n",
    "100 measurements: 10.0ms ± 0.5ms\n",
    "  → Statistically valid\n",
    "  → Confidence: \"Next run will likely be 9.5-10.5ms\"\n",
    "  → Can detect if update made things worse\n",
    "```\n",

    "  ❌ Rerunning until you get good numbers\n",
    "  ❌ Omitting variance in reporting\n",
