    "## 💡 Introduction - What is Fair Benchmarking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarking in ML systems isn't just timing code - it's about making fair, reproducible comparisons that guide real optimization decisions. Think of it like standardized testing: everyone takes the same test under the same conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider comparing three models: a base CNN, a quantized version, and a pruned version. Without proper benchmarking, you might conclude the quantized model is \"fastest\" because you measured it when your CPU was idle, while testing the others during peak system load. Fair benchmarking controls for these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge: ML models have multiple competing objectives (accuracy vs speed vs memory), measurements can be noisy, and \"faster\" depends on your hardware and use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Benchmarking as a Systems Engineering Discipline\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional ML benchmarking requires understanding measurement uncertainty and controlling for confounding factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Foundations**: We need enough measurements to achieve statistical significance. Running a model once tells you nothing about its true performance - you need distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Noise Sources**:\n",
    "- **Thermal throttling**: CPU frequency drops when hot\n",
    "- **Background processes**: OS interrupts and other applications\n",
    "- **Memory pressure**: Garbage collection, cache misses\n",
    "- **Network interference**: For distributed models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fair Comparison Requirements**:\n",
    "- Same hardware configuration\n",
    "- Same input data distributions\n",
    "- Same measurement methodology\n",
    "- Statistical significance testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This module builds infrastructure that addresses all these challenges while generating actionable insights for optimization decisions."

    "## 📐 Mathematical Foundations - Statistics for Performance Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarking is applied statistics. We measure noisy processes (model inference) and need to extract reliable insights about their true performance characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Central Limit Theorem in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a model many times, the distribution of measurements approaches normal (regardless of the underlying noise distribution). This lets us:\n",
    "- Compute confidence intervals for the true mean\n",
    "- Detect statistically significant differences between models\n",
    "- Control for measurement variance\n",

    "## Multi-Objective Optimization Theory\n",

    "ML systems exist on a **Pareto frontier** - you can't simultaneously maximize accuracy and minimize latency without trade-offs. Good benchmarks reveal this frontier:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Accuracy\n",
    "    ↑\n",
    "    |  A ●     ← Model A: High accuracy, high latency\n",

    "## Measurement Uncertainty and Error Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Every measurement has uncertainty. When combining metrics (like accuracy per joule), uncertainties compound:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Systematic errors**: Consistent bias (timer overhead, warmup effects)\n",
    "- **Random errors**: Statistical noise (thermal variation, OS scheduling)\n",
    "- **Propagated errors**: How uncertainty spreads through calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional benchmarking quantifies and minimizes these uncertainties."

    "\n",
    "Single metrics mislead. Consider these three models:\n",
    "- **Model A**: 95% accuracy, 100ms latency, 50MB memory\n",
    "- **Model B**: 90% accuracy, 20ms latency, 10MB memory\n",
    "- **Model C**: 85% accuracy, 10ms latency, 5MB memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is \"best\"? It depends on your constraints:\n",
    "- **Server deployment**: Model A (accuracy matters most)\n",
    "- **Mobile app**: Model C (memory/latency critical)\n",
    "- **Edge device**: Model B (balanced trade-off)\n",

    "MLPerf (created by MLCommons) is the industry-standard ML benchmarking framework. Understanding these principles grounds your capstone competition in professional methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reproducibility:** Fixed hardware specs, software versions, random seeds, and multiple runs for statistical validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standardization:** Fixed models and datasets enable fair comparison. MLPerf has two divisions:\n",
    "- **Closed:** Same models/datasets, optimize systems (hardware/software)\n",
    "- **Open:** Modify models/algorithms, show innovation\n",
    "\n",
    "**TinyMLPerf:** Edge device benchmarks (<1MB models, <100ms latency, <10mW power) that inspire the capstone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document everything for reproducibility\n",
    "2. Use same baseline for fair comparison\n",
    "3. Measure multiple metrics (accuracy, latency, memory, energy)\n",
    "4. Optimize for real deployment constraints\n",
