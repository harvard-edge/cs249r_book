    "## 🚀 MODULE SUMMARY: Compression\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've built a comprehensive model compression system that can dramatically reduce model size while preserving intelligence!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Accomplishments\n",
    "- Built magnitude-based and structured pruning techniques with clear sparsity patterns\n",
    "- Implemented knowledge distillation for teacher-student compression with temperature scaling\n",
    "- Created low-rank approximation using SVD decomposition for matrix factorization\n",
    "- Developed sparsity measurement and comprehensive compression pipeline\n",
    "- Analyzed compression trade-offs between size, speed, and accuracy with real measurements\n",
    "- All tests pass ✅ (validated by `test_module()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Systems Insights Gained\n",
    "- **Structured vs Unstructured**: Hardware-friendly sparsity patterns vs maximum compression ratios\n",
    "- **Compression Cascading**: Multiple techniques compound benefits but require careful sequencing\n",
    "- **Accuracy Preservation**: Knowledge distillation maintains performance better than pruning alone\n",
    "- **Memory vs Speed**: Parameter reduction doesn't guarantee proportional speedup without sparse libraries\n",
    "- **Deployment Strategy**: Different scenarios (mobile, edge, cloud) require different compression approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Mastery\n",
    "- **Sparsity Measurement**: Calculate and track zero weight percentages across models\n",
    "- **Magnitude Pruning**: Global thresholding based on weight importance ranking\n",
    "- **Structured Pruning**: Channel-wise removal using L2 norm importance metrics\n",
    "- **Knowledge Distillation**: Teacher-student training with temperature-scaled soft targets\n",
    "- **Low-Rank Approximation**: SVD-based matrix factorization for parameter reduction\n",
    "- **Pipeline Integration**: Sequential application of multiple compression techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ready for Next Steps\n",
    "Your compression implementation enables efficient model deployment across diverse hardware constraints!\n",
    "Export with: `tito module complete 16`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**: Module 17 will add acceleration techniques including vectorization and kernel fusion, building on compression for maximum efficiency!"
