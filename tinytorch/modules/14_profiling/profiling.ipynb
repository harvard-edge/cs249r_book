    "## 💡 Introduction: Why Profiling Matters in ML Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a detective investigating a performance crime. Your model is running slowly, using too much memory, or burning through compute budgets. Without profiling, you're flying blind - making guesses about what to optimize. With profiling, you have evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Performance Investigation Process:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Suspect Model → Profile Evidence → Identify Bottleneck → Target Optimization\n",
    "     ↓               ↓                    ↓                    ↓\n",
    "   \"Too slow\"    \"200 GFLOP/s\"      \"Memory bound\"      \"Reduce transfers\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions Profiling Answers:**\n",
    "- **How many parameters?** (Memory footprint, model size)\n",
    "- **How many FLOPs?** (Computational cost, energy usage)\n",
    "- **Where are bottlenecks?** (Memory vs compute bound)\n",
    "- **What's actual latency?** (Real-world performance)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Importance:**\n",
    "In production ML systems, profiling isn't optional - it's survival. A model that's 10% more accurate but 100× slower often can't be deployed. Teams use profiling daily to make data-driven optimization decisions, not guesses.\n",

    "## 📐 Foundations: Performance Measurement Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build our profiler, let's understand what we're measuring and why each metric matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter Counting - Model Size Detective Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters determine your model's memory footprint and storage requirements. Every parameter is typically a 32-bit float (4 bytes), so counting them precisely predicts memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter Counting Formula:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Linear Layer: (input_features × output_features) + output_features\n",
    "               ↑              ↑                    ↑\n",
    "            Weight matrix   Bias vector      Total parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Linear(768, 3072) → (768 × 3072) + 3072 = 2,362,368 parameters\n",
    "Memory: 2,362,368 × 4 bytes = 9.45 MB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### FLOP Counting - Computational Cost Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) measure computational work. Unlike wall-clock time, FLOPs are hardware-independent and predict compute costs across different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FLOP Formulas for Key Operations:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Matrix Multiplication (M,K) @ (K,N):\n",
    "   FLOPs = M × N × K × 2\n",
    "           ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑\n",
    "        Rows Cols Inner Multiply+Add\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Layer Forward:\n",
    "   FLOPs = batch_size × input_features × output_features × 2\n",
    "                      ↑                  ↑                 ↑\n",
    "                  Matmul cost        Bias add        Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution (simplified):\n",
    "   FLOPs = output_H × output_W × kernel_H × kernel_W × in_channels × out_channels × 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Profiling - The Three Types of Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "ML models use memory in three distinct ways, each with different optimization strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Type Breakdown:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total Training Memory = Parameters + Activations + Gradients + Optimizer State\n",
    "                           ↓            ↓           ↓            ↓\n",
    "                        Model         Forward     Backward     Adam: 2×params\n",
    "                        weights       pass cache  gradients    SGD: 0×params\n",
    "\n",
    "Example for 125M parameter model:\n",
    "Parameters:    500 MB (125M × 4 bytes)\n",
    "Activations:   200 MB (depends on batch size)\n",
    "Gradients:     500 MB (same as parameters)\n",
    "Adam state:  1,000 MB (momentum + velocity)\n",
    "Total:      2,200 MB (4.4× parameter memory!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latency Measurement - Dealing with Reality\n",
    "\n",
    "Latency measurement is tricky because systems have variance, warmup effects, and measurement overhead. Professional profiling requires statistical rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency Measurement Best Practices:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Measurement Protocol:\n",
    "1. Warmup runs (10+) → CPU/GPU caches warm up\n",
    "2. Timed runs (100+) → Statistical significance\n",
    "3. Outlier handling → Use median, not mean\n",
    "4. Memory cleanup → Prevent contamination\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeline:\n",
    "Warmup: [run][run][run]...[run] ← Don't time these\n",
    "Timing: [⏱run⏱][⏱run⏱]...[⏱run⏱] ← Time these\n",
    "Result: median(all_times) ← Robust to outliers\n",
