# Module ABOUT.md Template

This template defines the standardized structure for all module ABOUT.md files used in the Jupyter Book site.

## Key Design Decisions

Based on expert review (David Patterson, Education Reviewer, Website Manager):

1. **No YAML frontmatter** - Was not used by build system, created maintenance burden
2. **Learning Objectives before Overview** - Pre-organizes cognitive schema for better learning
3. **Time estimates in Build → Use → Reflect** - Enables self-pacing
4. **Checkpoints in Implementation Guide** - Progress validation every 90-120 minutes
5. **No manual prev/next navigation** - Auto-generated by Jupyter Book

## Standard Structure

```markdown
# Module Name

**[TIER]** | Difficulty: ●●○○ (2/4) | Time: X-Y hours | Prerequisites: Module XX

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **[Action verb]**: [Specific, measurable outcome with systems context]
- **[Action verb]**: [Outcome connecting to production frameworks]
- **[Action verb]**: [Outcome with performance/complexity awareness]
- **[Action verb]**: [Outcome linking to real-world applications]
- **[Action verb]**: [Outcome demonstrating systems thinking]

## Overview

[2-3 paragraphs covering:]
- What you're building (concrete deliverable)
- Why it matters (motivation and real-world relevance)
- Where it fits in ML systems (context within TinyTorch and production frameworks)

## Build → Use → Reflect

This module follows TinyTorch's **Build → Use → Reflect** framework:

1. **Build** (~X hours): [What students implement - specific components]
2. **Use** (~Y hours): [How they apply it - concrete scenarios]
3. **Reflect** (~Z hours): [Systems thinking - quantitative questions]

## Implementation Guide

### [Component 1 Name]

[Explanation of what this component does and why]

```python
# Code example with clear comments
from tinytorch.core.module import Component

# Usage pattern
example = Component(...)
result = example.method(...)
```

**Systems insight**: [Connection to production frameworks, performance implications, or architectural decisions]

### [Component 2 Name]

[Continue with additional components...]

---

**CHECKPOINT 1**: [What capability is now unlocked]

What you can do now: [Concrete demonstration of progress]

Progress: ~X% through module | Time invested: ~Y hours | Remaining: ~Z hours

---

### [Component 3 Name]

[Continue implementation...]

---

**CHECKPOINT 2**: [Next capability unlocked]

Progress: ~X% through module | Remaining: ~Z hours

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Complete these modules first:

```bash
# Activate TinyTorch environment
source scripts/activate-tinytorch

# Verify prerequisites
tito test [prerequisite1]
tito test [prerequisite2]
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Open the development file**: `src/[NN]_[modulename]/[NN]_[modulename].py`
2. **Implement [component 1]**: [Brief description]
3. **Build [component 2]**: [Brief description]
4. **Add [component 3]**: [Brief description]
5. **Export and verify**: `tito test [NN]`

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite

```bash
# TinyTorch CLI (recommended)
tito test [NN]

# Direct pytest execution
python -m pytest tests/[NN]_[modulename]/ -v
```

### Test Coverage Areas

- **[Area 1]**: [What is tested and why it matters]
- **[Area 2]**: [What is tested]
- **[Area 3]**: [What is tested]

### Manual Testing Examples

```python
from tinytorch.core.[module] import [Component]

# Test basic functionality
component = Component(...)
result = component.method(...)
assert result.shape == expected_shape
print("Basic functionality working")
```

## Production Context

### Your Implementation vs. PyTorch

| Feature | Your Implementation | PyTorch |
|---------|--------------------| --------|
| [Feature 1] | [Your approach] | [Production approach] |
| [Feature 2] | [Your approach] | [Production approach] |

**What's the same**: [Core concepts that transfer directly]

**What's different**: [Production optimizations you're not implementing]

### Real-World Applications

- **[Company/Domain]**: [How this concept is used at scale]
- **[Company/Domain]**: [Another production example]

## Systems Thinking Questions

### Computational Analysis

- [Quantitative question with concrete parameters, e.g., "For a batch size of 32 with 512-dimensional embeddings, calculate the memory required for..."]
- [Scaling question, e.g., "How does computational cost change when doubling sequence length?"]

### Architectural Trade-offs

- [Design decision question, e.g., "Why does PyTorch use X approach instead of Y?"]
- [Trade-off analysis, e.g., "When would you choose dense vs. sparse representation?"]

### Performance Characteristics

- [Measurement question, e.g., "Profile the forward pass - which operation dominates?"]
- [Optimization question, e.g., "What would you change to reduce memory by 50%?"]

## What's Next

**Module [NN+1]: [Name]** - [Brief description of what comes next and how it builds on this module]

## Ready to Build?
