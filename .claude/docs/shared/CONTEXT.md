# Machine Learning Systems Engineering: Educational Context

## Our Target Audience

**Primary**: University students (Junior through PhD) in:
- Computer Science
- Computer Engineering  
- Electrical Engineering (transitioning to ML systems)

**Secondary**: Industry practitioners learning ML systems

## Academic Level Expectations

### Junior/Senior Undergraduates
- Have taken: Data structures, algorithms, at least one systems course
- Exposure varies widely: Some have taken OS/Architecture, others haven't
- Programming: Comfortable in Python/Java, maybe some C/C++
- Math: Had calculus/linear algebra, but rusty on details

### Master's Students
- Mixed backgrounds: Some straight from undergrad, others returning from industry
- International students may have different curriculum backgrounds
- Stronger programming skills, but systems knowledge varies

### PhD Students (Years 1-3)
- Using this for research in ML systems
- Need both breadth and depth
- May be teaching assistants using this material

## Pedagogical Philosophy: "Meet Them Where They Are"

Since we can't assume uniform background, we:

1. **Introduce systems concepts as needed** - Don't assume deep systems knowledge
2. **Build ML knowledge from scratch** - This is intro to ML systems
3. **Use footnotes liberally** - Help students with varying backgrounds
4. **Connect to what they know** - Programming, basic algorithms, math they've seen

## Language Guidelines for Introduction Chapter

### Can use (they've heard these words):
- CPU, GPU, memory, algorithm, network
- Python, programming, function, loop
- Data, database, file, cloud

### Need quick explanation via footnote:
- TPU ("Google's custom chip for ML")
- FPGA ("Programmable hardware")
- Cache hierarchy (if going deep)
- Distributed systems (if discussing architecture)

### Must properly introduce (ML-specific):
- Neural networks (what they actually are)
- Training vs inference
- Backpropagation (the key algorithm)
- Model, weights, parameters
- CNN, RNN, Transformer (the architectures)

## The Challenge This Book Addresses

Students often have:
- **CS Theory** but lack **systems depth**
- **Programming** skills but lack **ML knowledge**
- **Math** background but lack **engineering practice**

This book bridges ALL these gaps to create ML Systems Engineers.

## Review Principles

1. **Don't assume systems knowledge** - Many CS students never took OS/Architecture
2. **Don't assume ML knowledge** - This is their introduction
3. **Do assume intelligence** - They can learn complex topics if explained well
4. **Do assume programming** - They can read and write code

## The Goal

By the end of this book, students should understand:
- How ML algorithms actually work
- How to build systems that train and serve ML models
- The engineering challenges at scale
- The hardware/software co-design space
- How to make practical engineering decisions

We're creating the first generation of engineers who truly understand both the ML and the systems, not just one or the other.
