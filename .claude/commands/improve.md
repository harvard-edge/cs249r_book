Review + automatic improvement application for ML Systems textbook chapters.

Runs full multi-perspective review FIRST, then applies high-consensus improvements. Creates clean diffs for GitKraken review with important constraints respected.

Usage: `/improve introduction.qmd`

## How It Works

1. **Full Review First** - Same as `/review` command
2. **Consensus Analysis** - Identifies high-agreement issues
3. **Smart Application** - Applies improvements with constraints
4. **Git Branch** - Safe experimentation environment

## Important Constraints

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Never Modified
- **TikZ code blocks** - All `.tikz` environments preserved exactly
- **Mathematical equations** - LaTeX math left untouched
- **Figure references** - @fig- references maintained

### üìù Special Rules  
- **Purpose sections** - Kept as SINGLE paragraph only
- **No markdown comments** - Clean diffs for GitKraken
- **Preserve formatting** - Maintain existing style

## Consensus Thresholds

- **5+ reviewers agree**: Auto-apply (critical)
- **4 reviewers agree**: Auto-apply (high priority)
- **3 reviewers agree**: Apply if safe
- **2 or fewer**: Document only

## Review Perspectives

**Students (Progressive Validation):**
- CS Junior: Has systems background, learning ML
- CS Senior: Some ML knowledge, learning deployment
- Masters: Strong foundation, production focus

**Experts (Technical Accuracy):**
- Systems Engineer: Scalability and operations
- ML Practitioner: Algorithm to production
- Data Engineer: Pipeline and quality

## Output

1. **Scorecard** - Same as `/review` output
2. **Applied changes** - Direct file improvements
3. **Git branch** - `improve-[chapter]-[date]`
4. **Summary report** - What was changed and why

## Example Workflow

```bash
# First, just review without changes
/review introduction.qmd  

# If scorecard looks good, apply improvements
/improve introduction.qmd

# Review changes in GitKraken
# Stage what you like, discard what you don't
```

The system ensures your textbook teaches AI engineering effectively while maintaining technical accuracy and pedagogical quality.
