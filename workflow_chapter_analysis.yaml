    key_issues:
      - "Multiple redundant explanations of lifecycle integration principles"
      - "Systems thinking concepts introduced early but repeated extensively later"
      - "DR case study setup repeated across multiple sections"
      - "Feedback loop concepts explained multiple times with similar language"
      - "Some transitions between lifecycle stages feel formulaic"

      issue_type: "circular_reference"
      description: "The preview explains the three principles in detail, but then the full Systems Thinking section later repeats the same content. This creates confusion about which is the 'real' explanation."

A data collection choice influences model architecture options; deployment environment limitations affect training strategies; monitoring insights drive data collection improvements.\n\n**Continuous Feedback**: Unlike traditional waterfall development, ML systems operate through multiple nested feedback loops. Short-term loops enable rapid iteration during development, while long-term loops drive strategic evolution. These feedback mechanisms ensure systems adapt to changing requirements and real-world conditions.\n\n**Emergent Complexity**: AI systems exhibit emergent behaviors that arise from component interactions rather than individual component design. System-wide patterns become visible only when examining the complete workflow, requiring holistic monitoring and analysis capabilities."
